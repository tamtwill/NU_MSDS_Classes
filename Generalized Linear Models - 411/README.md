# Generalized Linear Models

### Course Description
This course extends linear “OLS” regression by introducing the concept of Generalized Linear Model “GLM” regression. The course reviews traditional linear regression and then continues with logistic regression, poisson regression, and survival analysis. The course is heavily weighted towards practical application with large data sets containing missing values and outliers. It addresses issues of data preparation, model development, model validation, and model deployment.

### Learning Goals
The goals of this course are to:
+ Determine the appropriate generalized linear model or models for a given data set
+  Prepare data for regression analysis by detecting and handling outliers and missing values
+  Develop statistically sound and robust generalized linear models
+  Deploying generalized linear models capable of scoring new data

#### Course Work
This course is divided into units. Each unit will cover a specific topic of Generalized Linear Models. The first three units are each three weeks in length and will have textbook reading, handouts, quizzes, a major project, and optional projects. 

### Bonus Assignments
Some units will also contain one or more bonus assignments. These assignments may entail downloading a data set and then building a model, and then scoring a data set. They are strictly bonus point work and are intended for the advanced students.
