# Introduction to Statistical Analysis


### Overview
Two data analysis projects are required in this course. The first project entails exploratory data analysis of an abalone data set. The second project involves statistical inference using analysis of variance and linear regression. Success with these projects will require application of course concepts and coding with R resulting in submission of a professionally rendered report.
Topics covered during Sessions 1-5 pertain to the first analysis project.  A report is due the end of Session 5. 

The second project uses topics covered during Sessions 6-9. A report is due at the end of the course. These reports are expected to conform to professional standards comparable to what is required in subsequent Predictive Analytics courses.

#####  Assignment 1 
Is an exploratory data analysis with the objective to determine plausible reasons why the original study was not successful in predicting age based on physical characteristics. This assignment is the precursor for the following assignment.

##### Assignment 2 
Will address development of binary decision rules for harvesting abalones.
