The plastic rings around the elevator buttons were broken. The floors were grimy. The outlets were so old and loose that my Mac charger would fall out. The one soda machine was out of water and more than half of the other beverages, and it had a piece of paper taped to it saying that beverages cost $2. There was no fitness room as advertised, instead it looks like they were using the room to store mattresses--a possible sign that they are dealing with bed bugs. The tile was broken. The tinting on the widows was torn and partially missing. There was no carpet in the downstairs hallway. The \u2018business center\u2019 was two crappy mismatching chairs, a few brochures, and a hanging power strip. Also, the one person working there sent me to an occupied room where another lodger was watching TV. I slept on top of the sheets with the lights on in hopes of keeping away bed bugs. This place is currently rated as a 2.5-star hotel and costs a typical $110 - $140, but that is not even close to an accurate star rating.

There is a light rail stop almost in front of the hotel, which made it very convenient. The hotel itself was average in terms of looks. My room was a good size, with a king size bed and a desk to work at. The wifi was pretty reliable, although I got better reception with my iPhone than my laptop. The bed was quite nice. There is a decent complimentary breakfast at the lobby restaurant. The walls of the restaurant are painted with blackboard paint, and there is chalk provided so guests can add notes or artwork to the wall. There is also a small gallery in one hall of the hotel featuring what I assumed to be local artists. The Lexington is located in what is called the \"arts district\" of Phoenix. It is a short walk to the museum and to Roosevelt Row, where there is a collection of art galleries, artist studios, tattoo shops, and hipster cafes. It is also a short walk to downtown, where there are some decent restaurants and a movie theater. This was a pleasant surprise as we didn't want to have to drive everywhere.

The free high-speed internet was great for email and small productions but slow for graphics-intensive work. It is still a great perk. Because we were on a business trip, I was very leery of giving my credit card for \"incidentals.\" Twice before at other places the front desk has billed my card instead of our purchase order. I spoke to two front desk clerks at check-in and check-out and both of them gave me the evil eye (in my opinion) when I brought this up. They were brief, bordering on rude, but they did ensure that the PO was billed appropriately. I could have done without the attitude. One of the desk clerks, a dark-haired woman with an eastern European accent was very nice to my coworker and knew all about the PO situation with our business. She deserves special recognition. The building appears to be on permanent lock-down, as the only way in is through the front door, away from the main parking area. I respect the need for more security, but what about card readers at the outside doors for guests? Some things future guests here should be aware of: there is construction all along Central Avenue right by the hotel and they are ripping up the road to build a light-rail. This is not the BW's fault, and of course I support the project but it makes it very difficult to actually find your way into the hotel. To get in, find your way to 3rd Ave, which is west of central ave. Then go north about two blocks to Portland street, turn right on Portland, then travel down a street of residential condos. go around the semi-circle at the end of Portland (next to Central) and look for the entrance for the hotel. Consult a street map before you go! At $222 for two nights, I would say that this BW is only a fair value for the price.

One room was on one floor, 3 were on another, and the last was way up top. Being way spread out would have been OK until we got to the rooms. All 4 lower rooms were 80 degrees and above. We were assured that the rooms would be cool by the time we got back from our concert. After the concert we had to change 4 of the rooms twice trying to find cooler floors. We finally gave up at 12:30 a.m. with a room that was 77 degrees - still too warm. And the room did not even have a shower curtain! I understand they are going through renovations, but they need to either do it floor by floor and close that floor or close the entire hotel until finished. The only nice thing was the free shuttle to America West Arena.", "Date": "August 7, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAdministrative Issues\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR929830", "Content": "The Best Western Executive Park Hotel is an average place to stay (though a bit far from downtown) with a substandard management team.

When I spoke with the hotel prior to booking, I was told that the hotel was a couple of blocks and within walking distance of the civic center. I walked it the first time and would never do it again. Not only was it more than a mile walk, but it was a walk through a less than desireable part of downtown. Therefore, I opted to pay unexpected taxi charges to guarantee my safety and state of mind. The room I stayed in and it's amenities was very nice. The hotel staff and restaurant/bar staff were great.... although the front desk was oddly unmanned upon my checkout (I waited about 15 min. then left to catch my flight). Strange Hugh???? In a nutshell, my stay was less than I expected by way of hotel amenities that I felt I paid for and very disappointing in locale.
