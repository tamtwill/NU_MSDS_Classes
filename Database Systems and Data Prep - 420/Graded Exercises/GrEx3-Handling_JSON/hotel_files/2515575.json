The room was adequate with comfortable beds and plenty of storage space. The bathroom consisted of a bath/shower and toilet with the sink outside the bathroom. Unlike many hotels, the vanity area was very small and there was very little room to set out toiletries, especially with two persons using the sink. Housekeeping did a good job of keeping things clean, except for two large black smudges on the draw drapes. The hotel is located very close to the Rio Vista trolley stop which made getting around very convenient. I would also like to recommend a very nice coffee shop about a block and a half away (if you're at the hotel, head toward the plaza with the Sears that will soon be a K-Mart - the coffee shop is in a professional/residential building on the corner, across the street). They have delicious breakfast sandwiches, great coffee and pastries for breakfast, all reasonably priced. They also have free WiFi, which brings me to my major critique of this Marriott. I fail to understand why mid-price hotels, such as Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn Expess, etc., offer free WiFi in the guest rooms, while Marriotts and other upper-end hotels charge, as in this case, $12.95 per day for the privilege of getting connected. They even charge for the two \"business center\" computers off the lobby, requiring you to swipe your credit card. There is also no free breakfast, and the least expensive cooked item on the hotel restaurant breakfast menu is $14.00. Adding in the parking charge, it just seemed like the guests are being nickled and dimed when they are already paying a premium price for a hotel room.

I brought this to the attention of the front desk, and they apologized, offered us a new room, and provided us a small perk for our troubles. We did not take the new room, as we were unpacked and getting ready for a wedding...so when my wife found a bug in the room the next morning, we were a little frustrated, especially because the front desk did not send someone to deal with it immediately. However, upon the cleaning staff finding out, they took care of the problem immediately and with care and compassion.

The lobby is elegant and airy and the staff was friendly. All of the rooms have balconies, and our view of Mission Valley was photo-worthy. We could also look down into the gorgeous pool area (though we didn\u2019t have time to use it, since we were there for Comic-Con). There are obvious disadvantages: no free internet, and it\u2019s far from the convention center -- but we knew about these before we arrived. We took the trolley to the con the first morning, before we had our badges, and then took the shuttle after that. The trolley is a ten-minute walk away and the shuttle stop is at the back of the hotel, so it wasn\u2019t too inconvenient. The trip was too long to make twice in one day, however -- we just left early in the morning and came back at night to sleep. There's a shopping center a 15-minute walk from the hotel that has both a Costco and a Starbucks. The Costco was great for a quick, cheap dinner -- their pizza is always good. The Starbucks has free Internet. The reason I can\u2019t recommend this hotel is the faulty toilet in our room and the apparent inability of the staff to fix it. We noticed it flushed slowly the first day but didn\u2019t think anything of it until the toilet actually overflowed the next morning, flooding the bathroom. We called the front desk and security came up. He said he could fix and sanitize the bathroom, or we could move to another room. Since we liked the room (on the 12th floor) and the alternative was on the 3rd floor, we opted to stay. Big mistake -- that night the toilet started slowing down and filling up again. It didn\u2019t actually overflow again, but it looked like it was about to, so we told the front desk the next morning. Again they promised to fix it and clean up, but we had anxiety about it overflowing again. We used the bathroom in the lobby instead, our last night. When we checked out the next morning we complained and the receptionist promised to send an engineer up to look at it -- which didn\u2019t help us much. She also offered us a free breakfast, but we\u2019d already eaten. She said she couldn\u2019t offer us any kind of refund because we\u2019d booked through a third party. No other compensation was offered.

Maybe I was just jaded because I had just stayed at an Embassy where everything is complimentary and the staff are more than willing to make your stay comfortable but the unexpected parking and wi-fi charges really burned me up. $27 PER DAY!!!!!!!!!!

I am a platinum Marriott Rewards member but I don't think it got me anything special other than free breakfast. Check in - smooth and easy. I don't think the hotel was that busy and there was no wait. I did ask to be moved to a room with a sofa bed and they did that quickly. Room - The room was a standard king room with pull out sofa. It's more than enough space with 2 people in a room, but with the sofa bed pulled out, it was really tight (I do expect it since it's a normal room, but just mentioning to others traveling with kids to plan accordingly). Bed was comfortable and nice flat screen TV with plenty of movies. I was on the 16th floor. Small fridge and microwave was under the TV. The sink/vanity was separate from the bath/toilet which is a nice plus. Concierge Lounge - As platinum, usually get lounge access but was closed over the holiday week. Did get two free appetizers and two free buffet breakfast certificates so that was nice. I did miss my free diet Pepsi's though :) Parking - the parking was like $13 for self parking. There was plenty of space and there is a valet option too. Restaurant/bar - We stopped in for a late night snack with the free appetizers and the wife had a salad. Again, very typical of the Marriott restaurants. Small menu but different variety and about the price you'd expect at a hotel. Quality was fine but nothing over the top. The breakfast buffet was nice. Egg station and the rest of the normal things (bacon, sausage, fruit, yogurt, waffles, danish, toast, etc. It was nice that I get it free and the kids got theirs free too (not sure what the age break is, but breakfast is free with \"paying\" adult for the kids). Amenities - We didn't do anything but eat and sleep so don't know about the pool or workout room. There is a shot that has souvenirs and basic snacks and amenities. I would recommend this hotel to business people or families traveling. If you've stay at Marriott's often, you'll see this is very similar to most. Great service, clean, functional.

The pool is really quite lovely. It was kind of cool when we were there so the pool was usually all ours except for a few sunbathers. Lots of towels, chaise lounges and 3 pretty cabanas with furniture and hammocks. It was clean and well kept and relaxing with the music and large fountain. In the evening there were really yummy rocky road cookies in the lobby. But act fast because it's not an endless supply. Parking was $14 per day but we just parked along the street of the hotel for free with not much further to walk than from areas of the paid parking. Every room has a balcony which is nice to step out on for fresh air or just to look around the area. We faced I-8 but were never disturbed by road noise. We didn't have any trouble with the elevators being too slow. There are only 3 so if the hotel is packed I suppose it could get slow. This hotel is in a great location. It took 20-30 minutes to get to a lot of places we visited. Blocks to the San Diego Zoo, just a few miles from Sea World. We drove up to La Jolla to see the seals and Scripps aquarium and that didn't take long at all to get there. And if you want to go to the beaches, probably 20 minutes to those. And lots of shopping (high end and average) and places to eat. Now onto those beds. Oy! I don't think I've slept on anything as torturous as these beds! Hard and slightly sunken in the middle - and SMALL! They are only double beds! Who even offers double beds anymore? They tried to make them more comfortable with some kind of mattress cover but it fails to resolve the problem of the old, hard mattress. C'mon Marriott! You have a nice property in a great location - fork out a little money to give your customers a comfortable bed to sleep on! Other than that, the hotel was super quiet for sleeping and the rooms pretty spacious.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cIt is the people that make a hotel and this one has the BEST!\u201d", "Author": "MissouriMisty", "ReviewID": "UR56950266", "Content": "The hotel staff-from Housekeeping to the General Manager are the nicest and bend over backwards to make your stay an amazing experience!

Indeed for any city. We stayed for 2 nights midweek while visiting the Zoo and Wild Animal Park. As a base for both, Mission Valley is excellent as it's not downtown and neither is it out in the wilderness. I've stayed in a few Marriott hotels in the past, and regularly visit one for work meetings. I find them to be very dated to the 1990s and sometimes older. The Marriott brand has really done itself no favours with the d\u00e9cor in this or any other hotel. The dated feel permeates throughout leaving the guest with a disheartening feeling as you move through the hotel. The rooms are clean, however very dated. CRT television with very poor quality reception on almost all channels apart from ESPN. The internet usage was included in my rate, but is severely lacking in juice. The 'Wired for Business' LAN network for instance seems to be on a 10 Mbit network, which is a older technology and causes massive latency issues for anyone trying to establish a VPN to their office (especially trans-atlantic ones!). The restaurant is sparsely decorated and poorly laid out. Focus appears to be on the bar rather than the restaurant. However the food is very good. The New York strip is excellent as is the Caesar Salad. Again however, the Marriott's price-point kicks in. The food is very expensive here. Breakfast for example, which is excellent in both service and quality, is very expensive again. Over $40 for 2 people for what could count as a full Irish breakfast with coffee. Overall this is a good hotel to stay at. Given San Diego is plagued by conferences and business meetings from what I've seen and read, hotel prices are expensive as a result. My advice would be to stay perhaps further out, maybe in Escondido or something if you could find a nice hotel. Marriott Mission Valley is an OK hotel, but beware that it is both expensive and dated.

The trolley is just across the street from the hotel and runs until midnight during the weekend. It stops every 15 minutes. For $2.50/person/trip (or $5 all day) the trolley will take you all over San Diego, which is a great plus! We left our vehicle at the hotel the following day and took the trolley to Old Town.

Our room also came with a mini-fridge (however, I'm not sure all rooms are equipped with one). There was a nice breeze that came in through the sliding door at the balcony and we slept with the door open to take advantage of the fresh air. At 5pm, they have cookies and milk in the lobby. The front desk is more than happy to help you with directions and ideas (even providing maps) of things to do in the surrounding area.

I\u2019m not sure if it had something to do with the air circulation or plumbing but was definitely irritating when I had a couple more hours to sleep, or was trying to get ready for the day. Beyond those things though- this hotel was really great! The beds were extremely comfortable, and the pool area was immaculate and beautiful! I spend every free second poolside! The restaurant was a little pricey. It was $13 for the breakfast buffet of bagels, muffins etc, all of which you had to toast yourself. It ended up being easier to just sit down and specifically order what you wanted. The food was delicious though and the staff was tremendously pleasant and helpful. At one point, we were a little late for our provided breakfast and some of the items had already been removed but they replenished them and found us, to tell us they were back! Amazing customer service! This hotel is also in a great location near a trolley station that will take you to anywhere you could want to go in San Diego!

I didn't specify a King bed, and we got two double beds room. I didn't bother to switch to another room, as we are facing the pool and in the middle of the building, the view was quite nice from the balcony.

I believed the distance to the parking lot vs to my spot on the street is about the same. It's less than a minute walk from car to lobby. Hotel staff were very polite. The trolley station is just a block away and quite convenient. We took the trolley to Old Town, Gaslamp Qtr, Balboa Park without any problem. The beds are quite comfortable.

There's no safety box in the room, but they provide safety box service at the front desk for free. No refrigerator as well, but apparently you can request one if it's available.
