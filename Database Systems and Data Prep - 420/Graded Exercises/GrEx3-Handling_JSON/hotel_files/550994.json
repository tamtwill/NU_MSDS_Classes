If we should indicate minuses : small matter : rather complicated system with turning on TV (you must go via satelite / DVD module - not easy to catch it by yourself) BIG MINUS: coffee at breakfast. Something really not to our taste and not drinkable. Actually when you are in countries like Spain, Italy etc you have good reasons to expect one of their wonders: excellent coffee. At Meninas they serve coffee in flask (thermos) with hot / cold milk in other flasks. BRRR !.

As a result, it provides a convenient base to explore Madrid. The location is in easy walking distance to Retiro Market, Plaza Del Sol, Plaza Mayor, Palacio Real amongst other attractions. The hotel itself is nicely furnished, well maintained and spotlessly clean. I do have three suggestions: First, there should be a means to adjust the air conditioning, which was set too warm for these US tastes (The system has an override that does not allow a setting below 22C, regardless of what the thermostat allows, which if the setting was properly calibrated would be comfortable. Unfortunately there is no possibility the system was producing anywhere near 22C/72F air. The thermostat on my luggage read 80F.) Of greater concern was the staffs relative indifference and unwillingness to adjust the over ride. The second proposal would be to improve the coverage and speed of the WiFi, which was only available in the lobby, was very slow and had narrow bandwidth. The last recommendation would be to raise the subdued lighting in the rooms. Nevertheless, the staff was generally helpful and all seemed to have exceptional working knowledge of local restaurants and interesting shops that they were happy to share. The ownership should be especially recognized for even more attentive and committed customer service. I was exceptionally impressed by, Daniel He personally and patiently assisted me and my family to send a package back home (whew, far more bureaucratic than anything we would ever tolerate in the US). He was gracious, kind, patient and clearly committed to taking special care of his guests. Notwithstanding the aforementioned suggestions, I would absolutely recommend Hotel Meninas.

The Hotel is clean and smart and the location is fantastic. The staff all have excellent English and are always polite and helpful. The rooms are all a little on the compact side but are well furnished, light and comfortable. I would have given this hotel top marks however over my trips I have noticed that they are steadily reducing the offering at breakfast from once once a plush and abundant array of everything and anything you could think of, arranged beautifully and with care, towards a more sparse 'ready made' prepackaged feel. But by far the worst thing about breakfast on my most recent trip was the mess. The breakfast room was coming down with dirty plates and tables - some lying there caked in scraps of food for up to an hour (I initially left when I saw the mess to give them a chance to clean up - but 40 mins later when I came back, nothing had moved, just even more mess! . I witnessed people having to clear tables themselves as 15 of the 18 tables were completely covered in dirty plates etc, and the other three tables were occupied by other guests. It was truly shocking. The lady who was attending to breakfast seemed to be completely unbothered by the unhygienic swamp that had amassed and had no interest in clearing up. She would disappear for 15 minutes and then arrive with a plate of cheese, and then vanish again, leaving us to fend for ourselves among the mess. It was so bad that I complained, and on my final day there was an improvement but still wasn't ideal by any means.

Overall though this was the one \"dud\" of our trip. Issues began the first night we arrived when we were told the double bed we'd requested (and been told was available) wasn't actually available. They told us they'd take care of it the next day though, so we didn't mind too much. Then the sink plug in the bathroom got stuck so the sink wouldn't drain, and no one working that evening knew how to fix it. So we got to wash our hands, brush our teeth, etc., in the shower -- you never appreciate how helpful a sink is until you don't have one. The breakfast looked very good the next morning, but wasn't. Eggs were cold, pastries appeared to be pre-packaged, dry, and sickly sweet -- very different from what we were used to with spanish baked goods. The hot water for tea was luke warm at best. They played loud pop music incessantly, though I can't complain much since I never asked them to turn it off. We stayed four nights and were dreading breakfast by the third morning. The bed situation was \"resolved\" the next day by them pushing our two single beds together. In my initial contact email I had specifically asked not to have this, so I was a bit surprised. The gentleman at the front desk who I spoke to told me that this was the only solution as they didn't have any other rooms in our size with a double bed. He didn't seem to understand that the fact that they had promised me something different was a problem. He also pointed out that we couldn't tell the difference, which I found somewhat insulting since obviously we did feel the difference, falling into the crack between the two beds. He did not offer any discount or other compensation.

I've been in several hotels before but have never encountered such a kind, polite, professional, and efficient staff which made my stay wonderful! The location of the hotel can't be better!

If you want to walk to Paseo del Prado, where Madrid's famous museums are located, just walk through San Jeronimo street from Puerta del Sol and you'll arrive at Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and at Neptune square (from which you can walk to Museo del Prado).

Room was clean and tidy and within walking distance to just about all sights in Madrid - including the San Gines chocolateria where, since 1894, you can get THE best hot chocolate and churros and eat on cobblestones throughout the night.

Part 1 - The Hotel. The hotel is a boutique hotel. Our room had a small balcony that looked out on to a Parisian type street. The bed was large and comfortable and the room was clean. The bathroom had a large array of toiletries. There were a few little things that needed attention in the room. The bathroom door could not open and shut easily because the material it was made of had become wet at some stage and had swollen so badly it didn't swing properly and the toilet roll holder and toilet seat were both broken. It was generally quiet except for the rubbish trucks in the early hours each morning. It was in a very convenient location. We could easily walk to the Palacio area, the Plaza Mayor, one of the main shopping streets, Sol, art museums and many other tourist sites. When we wanted to venture further the metro was right at the end of the street. The staff were friendly and very helpful especially when one of us got food poisoning from their Opera Restaurant (not from the breakfast buffet). They all spoke English which was good for us because our Spanish is hopeless. The buffet breakfast was fantastic. The chef responsible for breakfast was excellent. She baked the bread, squeezed the fresh orange juice and added a lot of extra special touches. There was free wi-fi in the lounge. Part 2 - The Opera Restaurant We were arriving at Meninas after a 24 hour flight. When we read about the half-board option we thought we would do this so that we didn't have to worry about finding a place to eat each day. We were aware that many Spanish people have their main meal during the day but we asked for the dinner option because we figured if we were out for the day we could arrive back in the evening and enjoy dinner close to the hotel. This was our first mistake. The first evening the meal was OK but not great. On the second evening we were served a piece of pretty dry fried chicken and a heap of chips. That night one of us got very bad food poisoning which could only have been from the chicken. The next day the one of us that could still eat asked to change to lunch each day instead of dinner. After that we had a daily Menu del Dia which was very good. The other point about the restaurant is that the advertising on the website is slightly misleading. It appeared to us that each night when you dined there might be opera singing to listen to but this is in a separate dining room downstairs and is not part of the hotel deal.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cCute rooms, very nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Luv2travel122", "ReviewID": "UR124278009", "Content": "I loved the decor of the rooms with pink accents.

We walked and looked around at the palace, a cathedral, the 'new market' & Plaza Mayor. Came back after 11. The room still was not available, or so the same clerk said. We were too tired to walk more so we settled into the lobby chairs. A few minutes later, a manager type encouraged the clerk to look harder. What do you know, there was a room. But, it was not what we reserved - 1 double bed. I went back to the desk where another clerk said that we could have a room like we requested but it wouldn't have outside view. We said OK. When we went to the second room it was what we requested and had the outside view. Go figure. The room was small but clean and comfortable and had everything that we needed. The products were nice and the bathroom was large enough. The beds were comfortable but the lighting was poor. The breakfast buffet was excellent and included another version of Tortillas Espanole, pastries, coffee, fruits, meats, eggs, etc. plus white and sparkling wines. The juices and yogurts left something to be desired. The young woman staffing the breakfast worked like a galley slave to keep things refreshed and appealing.

Basically I looked around on TA and online and gave up on a really nice and cool luxury hotel in town....with a spa and the works....they all kinda had these weak offers or cost north of 500EUR p night....and still amenities that weren't our style- I mean for that price we wanted indoor/outdoor pool etc....none of that in MAD which is fine... So we went boutique in the heart of town....not too many tourists walking around which is important for us....Junior suite for four nights....the plan discover the town and the food. LOVED the location....You are right there- Metro, cabs, bus or better yet, walk...all the main sites and monuments also....Starbucks close too....basically you're covered. Service at the reception was very pleasant and helpful. Downsides- Yeah it's a bit odd that they don't have WIFI in the rooms, but my guess is that this is a seriously old building that was renovated and you just can't drop Access Points that easily- not without irradiating the whole building....so we went downstairs or connected with the cable in the room. Totally loved the 'old' feel of the building- they tried to keep some of that which is great- but for the sticklers they could work on keeping the details- paint, water marks, stains...but that wasn't our priority. What kinda irritated us with a Junior Suite was the whole 'two bed' thing- I was like huh? Queenbed is not a luxury option!!! TV's are a bit small for a suite....and connected through a slightly obscure cable box....but with a little effort we figured it out- didn't come to MAD to watch TV or movies....so whatever...location made up for it. Breakfast (till 11) was pretty good- nothing to blow your mind...but enough to fire you put to go charging into town for sightseeing and having lunch at 4...a special nod to the fresh squeezed OJ. Espresso is extra...but it's there. Bathroom for the suite was good but the amenities where a bit odd- who needs a shoe shine kit- how bout q-tips and moisturizer? We noted this and I'd be willing to bet that they will make the necessary changes. Plus they were filling it all up daily....no nickel and dining on the soap/shampoo....which I like. Apparently you can also use the gym at the Opera hotel next door- but I didn't bother (sounded like a really small gym) - there are a couple of good gyms available for 25Euros if you're keen to get a workout. So all in all it was a good stay- I liked the people, I didn't feel like I was in some major 'wannabe' hotel...(we dropped by the Westin for a sniff and frankly the word 'lame' just screamed in our minds... 'Hi I think I'm 5 star but the details and the crowd is 3 star'....and the tourists....yeah....thanks but no thanks. Meninas has a great location and it was clean and they were paying attention to us...yeah I have my bones to pick- but hey...welcome to international travel- unless you want to drop a G per night....dont expect to have your mind blown on every detail. I'd go back to Meninas. As for the food- make sure you do some research- lots of great stuff- but on average the TA recommendations sucked!

If you are the type of person that loves to walk around and keep busy during the day, and needs a nice, quality room to spend the night in, then this hotel is for you. Rooms and bathrooms are clean, polished, and comfortable. Slightly small, but, again, not meant to be dwelled in like you would at a luxury hotel. Beds are firm (which I like and apparently is the standard for Spain) and we had two pillows per person. The location is absolutely phenomenal. On a quite side street with the Opera and Santo Domingo metro stops only minutes away, and other central areas like the Plaza Mayor, Puerta del Sol, and Gran Via very walkable (10-20 mins). In the nearby plaza surrounding the Opera metro stop, there\u2019s a pharmacy (quite useful for my boyfriend who was battling a cold) and an Open-25 store (24-hour convenience store to pick up snacks, drinks, candy, and various products). And a few great restaurants like Vadebaco (directly across the street from the hotel) and the Caf\u00e9 El Opera (around the corner) were particularly closeby. Reception was nice, but we did most of our research beforehand on where to eat and what to do, so we only utilized them for basic questions (where is the closest pharmacy, etc). One reception girl in particular was really sweet when I was trying to find a nail salon (alas, Madrid lacks the plethora of nail salons like New York). I was lucky to have thoroughly read reviews, and I love a good night's sleep, so I requested a room facing the inside of the hotel in advance. I had no problems with outside noise, like some of the other guests who had street-facing rooms. I was also relieved that I opted out of the hotels that were directly on the Gran Via or other busy intersections which might have been equally central but were probably extra busy/noisy (especially Thursday to Saturday). At one point I was deciding between Hotel Meninas and Hotel Opera, which I later learned are sister properties and around the corner from one another. We wound up staying at both hotels on separate legs of our trip, and I think Hotel Opera has the slight edge for having wifi readily accessible in the hotel rooms.

My husband and I pretty much enjoy walking around and twice we walked from Paseo Del Prado to the hotel. Taking the Gran Via it is a 30 minute walk or so... We booked through the internet and got a fair deal for Madrid standarts. Of course you may find cheaper alternatives, but we wanted a big room, a big bathroom (with a nice shower) and a well located hotel. As we booked through the internet we got breakfast included in our daily rate. Otherwise we would have to pay E15 per person. We found breakfast to be very tasteful with a variety of juices, pastries, fruits, local foods (e.g. tortilla) and even wine for those who wanted to. If we had to pay E15 per person for breakfast, then I think I would eat somewhere else... The hotel is charming and we loved the decor in our room. Staff was really helpful and booked our shuttle to the airport (which I recommend). Why didn't I rate it excellent? Well, for two reasons: first, the internet in the rooms is cabled. Wi fi only in the lobby. And the internet connection is very, very slow. Sometimes we struggled for minutes to access a website or to download pictures. That was annoying! Please provide fast and wi fi in the room ASAP!!! Second, the street where the hotel is located seems to be a quiet street. Big mistake. At least during our stay... We could hear people talking in the street until (at least) 11:30 p.m. We had to sleep with our window open since air conditioning stopped working at the third day... Finnaly, the worst of all happened twice during our stay. I presume it happened during the days that glass was being collected from the trash.

The level of knowledge and service at the desk was poor. The female staff member on the desk in the early evening had no knowledge of local restaurants, neither could she give any suggestions. This was particularly disappointing as many restaurants are closed Sunday evening throughout Madrid and we had a challenge discovering what was open for business. I would recommend the Orient Cafe on the square, west of the Opera house - it offered the best service and food of the local restaurants we tried. I would consider this hotel a 3 star.

The hotel is lacking a little in natural light (this is to be expected when located in a small street), however this didn't bother us as we were barely in the hotel during the daytime. We did experience a drain type odor in our room in the afternoons, however the air-con helped to eradicate this instantly. The room we stayed in was a great size and provided us with everything we needed, however it was looking a little sparse on the decorating front. Our room was facing the street, on the fifth floor and in the eaves of the hotel, so our view was slightly obscured. Breakfast was included in our booking and it was lovely - both hot and cold, ranging from jamon, eggs, cereals and fruit, and to finish a selection of delicious cakes! We told the hotel it was our wedding anniversary before hand, and when we reached our room we were delighted to find a bottle of Cava sitting on ice awaiting our return - a really lovely touch!

We had a special rate with breakfast included and 4 nights for the price of three. I would recommend asking for a room with balcony (n.303) because there are other smaller and darker rooms on the courtyard which aren't as nice.

It's a boutique hotel tucked away on a quiet (by Madrid standards!) side street situated just behind the Opera House and 5 minutes walk from the Royal Palace and gardens. In fact it's central location means that you can reach all the major attractions and areas in Central Madrid on foot, which is the best way to get to see the city. Madrid comes alive at night and the buzz continues well into the early hours and without doubt the best feature of this hotel is that it's very quiet. We had an interior room, a must if you want to get any sleep. Don't be put off that the windows of an interior room won't offer a view; any rooms that face the street won't keep out the endless street/nightlife noise. Our room was a twin but the beds were pushed together and the room itself was quite small and basic, and everything seemed squeezed in, particularly as it had an unnecessarily large desk taking up so much space. If you are willing to pay about \u00a350.00 more a night you can get a bigger superior room but to be honest it's not worth it for the amount of time you're likely to spend at the hotel. Despite the room size it was clean, modern and the bathroom immaculate. The staircase and general decor are really lovely. Breakfast isn't included and we chose not to have it as it was \u20ac15.00 each, way overpriced considering what you can have for a lot less in any of the numerous cafes situated just around the corner. The reception staff are courteous but I was a little disappointed that they didn't acknowledge my birthday; even a card from the hotel or any other small gesture would have shown a more personal touch.

Currently we cannot apparently delete or edit a prior review on Trip Advisor. However in view of the efforts of the hotel to make us whole again I owe them an updated, balanced review. I accept management's explanation and apologies. I will undoubtedly return to Madrid (a city I really love) in the future and I would certainly consider staying at Hotel Meninas again. As I hope I conveyed even in my last review our stay itself at Meninas had actually been quite nice with the exception of the billing problems at check out. We love Madrid and I found the location, style and room design of Meninas to be close to ideal. Their breakfast was also very generous and the room and hotel in general were well maintained and clean. I also found the service overall to be very good with the exception of the problems at check out, which I believe now were likely anomalous and caused by temporary circumstances. The location of the hotel is also exceptional with great shopping, restaurants, bars and sights nearby and easy public transportation connections. I especially enjoyed the proximity to C. Cava Baja and C.Nuncio -- our favorite Madrid tapas crawl. In terms of sleep quality, there was no bother at all from adjoining rooms -- a substantial issue for me. However one night/early morning there was very very loud banging outside on the street from what I believe was garbage collection.

The decor is charming but is hiding a multitude of problems. All went well until we woke up the first morning in a puff of cigarette smoke - though in a non-smoking room. It must be the ventilation system. We got out as quickly as we could (not wanting all of our stuff to absorb the smell) and asked for a different room. The desk clerk acted like he didn't understand how it could smell but we insisted and he gave us another Mini Double. (We asked if he wanted to go up to experience it for himself but he was not allowed to leave the desk - funny, as we had to wait for other clerks who were outside smoking at other times). We wanted to stay in the room during the hot afternoon hours and watch a movie. However, there was a terrible buzzing noise coming from the circuit board which was cutting into our brains and driving us nuts. This is apparently a recurring problem that the hotel does not intend to fix. Their suggestion was to remove the key that controls the electricity of the room - so, to go without electricity. But then we wouldn't be able to watch a movie. They offered us the only other room \"of our type\" available and said that we should try it first, as they did not recommend it. We went in for 5 minutes and could hear the clerk's conversations with guests checking-in and the subway. We nearly got divorced arguing about which room was worse and we finally decided to keep the room with buzzing noise and no light. The DVD selection was terrible and we decided just to get out of the hotel. Also, there was no wifi signal in any of the rooms we tried. The clerks are obviously taught to empathize with guests but convince them that they have no power beyond exchanging bad rooms for even worse rooms. The fact that other rooms were available but that we were not given an upgrade was a terrible insult. As budget travelers, we feel that we were treated as second-class guests. And for the final blow, after we left we realized that we didn't get the complimentary glass of sangria that was promised when we made our reservation and advertised throughout the whole month on their website.

Decided we would use the metro to access the city from the airport. Hotel Meninas is on a street just off the Plaza Isabel II, where the Opera House and the Opera metro stop are. This involved 3 different line changes (with luggage) . Most platforms are accessed by escalators however be aware that some of these were out of use for maintenance and generally access to the outside pavement is via several flights of steps. Plaza Isabel II is presently undergoing some major rebuilding and only one entrance to the Opera Metro is open, from which you need to navigate your way round the edge of the square through the building work. We purchased a 5 day metro ticket ( euro 16pp)which includes the airport be aware that the ticket expires on the fifth day and doesn't run a strict 24 hours from time purchased.We had to buy a single ticket back to the airport that being said was only euro2pp. Once at Hotel Meninas we checked in without any issue our room 408 was at the end of quiet corridor with a window looking into a very narrow quadrant ( you really don't have a view only the sky above). Rooms are very nicely decorated (modern style) bathroom with large shower nicely appointed and clean. Air con proved to be an slight issue couldn't set the temperature lower than 22degrees. TV system a little confusing with 3 remotes to use the equipment (after seeing the front desk sorted this out .For us Brits no english channels available in room BBC World on in the foyer). As is usual for european hotels no Tea coffee facilities in room . Take your kettle. There is a small fridge (minibar) for you to keep milk in if required. Double bed in our room. Next time would probably ask for 2 singles as use to a King/Super king bed . We didn't have breakfast in the hotel.Lots of cafes and places available for breakfast throughout the city.. TWO MUST DO'S: Mercado de San Miguel just of Calle Mayor. This place was great in the evening for all things Tapas don't take an organised tour around the city just go here and do your own Tour of all the stalls; you can have a full meal here just perusing all the goodies on offer. Footie Fans: Do the guided tour of the Real Madrid Stadium at the Bernabeu. Wonderful tour you get to access virtually everywhere including the football benchs the changing rooms,the pitch,museum you c\\n even have a picture taken with your favourite football star. For all us ladies of a certain age out there I've put in a request for you to be able to have your photo taken with Jose. We then had lunch in the restaurant. A little expensive but worth it for the view alone. (food was very nice as well). We did the audio tour of the Royal Palace well worth the money, the one thing we felt was a little over the top was the commentary in the Armoury . (Far too long for us) Lots of famous museums choose one. Make sure you spend time outdoors and wander the lovely parks (Retiro, Park O'est and casa de campo (where there is a cable car back to Park Oest with terrific views of the city and Palace.))

I had notified them in advance that we wished to store our luggage while we did some sightseeing, but they were immediately able to offer us two rooms where we could put our bags, use the toilet and wash our travel weary faces. The other two rooms were ready when we returned from the Prado mid-afternoon. As far as the size of rooms, they did vary (ours was a good size and had a large closet and enormous bathroom,even if the room size itself wasn't large). The airconditioning functioned brilliantly and all of our friends said they were the most comfortable beds we had on the entire trip. The breakfast was wonderful both in quality and variety. Yogurts, pastry, eggs, juices, breads and lots of good coffee. The hotel is on a sweet little street, but there was construction down on the corner that went on all day-suprising to us in the 100 degree weather. City living necessitates night time trash pickup and being on the front side of the hotel we came awake briefly as they dropped a new dumpster for the neighborhood. We came back one afternoon to clean up before we headed out for chocolate and churros and the power was out in the hotel. The staff said the construction crew had cut a line. Emergency lights were on, and the manager was running around lighting candles so that we could sit and visit in the lobby which remained cool. By the time we got back the power had been restored. We found all of the staff friendly and with a good sense of humor. We had stopped at the tapa bar associated with the sister hotel Opera and when the lady tending the bar passed through the lobby of our hotel the next morning she waved and acknowledged us. If you want to be assured of quiet, do ask for an inner room. There is a light shaft, so they aren't too dark, but they do seem to be the smaller rooms.

For 4* with breakfast, under 100 Euros a night and centrally located, we were not sure what to expect. It was a super choice for us. We had a smaller room (504) on the top floor that overlooked the inner courtyard. It was extremely quiet. The only noise we heard in 3 nights was a little talking as other guests walked down the hall. The room had curtains that allowed us to black out the room so we were able to nap anytime of day. The hotel itself is located on a quiet side street minutes from the Opera metro station and the pedestrian friendly Calle del Arenal. It is in a completely renovated historic building with modern amenities, comfortable bed and pillows, modern and clean bathroom, and wood floors. (I hate carpet) We had a room with one double bed, but in future travels to Spain I would request the 2 twin bed option. We learned over time that they were always pushed together and generally you ended up with a larger room as the bed was more King sized. My only issue would have been the petit nature of the room. The breakfast was included in the price but would have cost us 15 Euros each otherwise. Madrid was our first stop on our trip and we appreciated being able to eat a good breakfast when we were jet lagged and heading out for a full day of sightseeing. The breakfast buffet was as good as we have seen anywhere in our travels in Europe. My last comment would be about the extremely helpful staff. Any time of day, any question, they were always pleasant. My husband was interested in finding an authentic paella and the woman at the front desk recommended her favorite place right around the corner on the Plaza de Oriente where we could stare at the Royal Palace as it lit up at nightfall.

Although my strong advice is DON\u2019T book through Hotels.com. They screwed up the booking which lost us almost a day of our four day break dragging luggage from one hotel to another and hanging around to check in and out. Despite Hotels.com email confirmation that a twin room had been booked as requested, when we arrived for a four night stay, the confirmation they'd sent to the hotel showed a double room had been booked. There were no twin rooms available that night. The hotel staff were very apologetic (even though they were not to blame) and very helpful. They booked a room for us that night at their sister hotel (\u2018Opera\u2019), which is also 4 star. They said we could either continue our stay at the Opera or come back to stay at Meninas from the following day. So the next morning I walked back to the Meninas and had a look at the room. It was much better than the Opera, so we dragged our luggage back to the Meninas. The staff could not have been more helpful. They dispatched staff up to the room to get it ready as a priority, and we were able to check in and leave our bags and enjoy the rest of our stay in Madrid. The hotel is in a quiet street right in the centre. The room was spacious; twin beds; full bathroom and a wardrobe /changing area in between the bedroom and bathroom. The breakfast was very good. The staff helped us get our bearings and gave us a map and information on things to see and how to get there. My other piece of advice is to book a transfer to/from the hotel. The hotel will do this for you. We used public transport on the way to the hotel and it was a bit of a nightmare. Lots and lots of steps to negotiate in the metro stations.

A hotel may have top notch amenities and features, however, if it lacks the most basic feature, then such primitive hotel cannot be and should not be compared to other leading hotels. Hotel Meninas is a 4-star hotel, and not cheap relative to other counterparts due to its location. When I am paying $150 - $200 for a night, I expect to get good sleep from the hotel. Unfortunately, I did not get good rest, which has a detrimental effect for your schedule if you are a tourist. The circuit board in the room made a loud buzzing noise, although my girlfriend and I are not sensitive to small noise, that noise really irritated us. After seeking 6 hours of sleep, due to the noise, we only got 2 hours of sleep. When we woke up at 10:45, we called the reception if we can still make it for the breakfast (as BK is open until 11), upon confirming we went down, only to be shut down by a staff saying that it was closed. I looked at my watch and said we still got 15 minutes, and she brushed it off, and we were forced to leave. When we told the reception about the noise from the circuit board, they seemed to have known about this problem. They called the electrician to fix it, and I was guaranteed that it should be fixed. Due to this mishap, our tour started at 11 and made a trip to Palacio Real, only to come back 2 hours later since we were so exhausted. At night when we came back, we were notified that an electrician has resolved the issue. We must say, that the electrician was a brilliant genius, as s/he tried minimizing noise by forcefully sticking in a cardboard to close the opening, rather than perhaps fixing the actual electrical circuit board. Bravo to the hotel, and the hired electrician\u2026 thanks to that, 1 hour sleep on our last night. When I confronted them about the problem, the receptionist said she\u2019s truly sorry, but please sign the receipt.

Although the location and the building itself lived up to expectations, the overall experience was disappointing. When checking into the room around 14:00 the first day (after strolling around for two hours following arrival, leaving the staff sufficient time to clean), I arrived in a 5th floor corridor and room where the air was stale (from smoking?), the room extremely dusty (floors had not been vaccum cleaned and there was a centimeter of dust on top of all mirrors, frames and other surfaces) and the bathroom superficially cleaned (traces of other people's use, including hair and dental cream, visible everywhere). The worst was the air filter in the bathroom, which was so grey and dusty it looked like it had not been touched for five years. As I suffer from dust allergy, I imemdiately felt pain in my eyes and my lungs, and I contacted the reception. They offered to send somebody to clean, but as I desperately needed some rest, we agreed that the room would be cleaned later in the afternoon, when my friend and I would go out for sightseeing/dinner. When we returned in the evening, there was NO improvement (nobody had cleaned), and the reception manger offered us to move to Hotel Opera down the street. As it was late and we had unpacked, we declined, but asked him to kindly leave a note for housekeeping the next morning, pointing out exactly what they should pay particular attention to. To make a long story short, there was absolutely no improvement in the cleaning the following two days, and I doubt if the staff in Meninas do anything more than make the beds when guests are staying. They certainly don't clean/use detergents in the bathroom, and the floors were never vaccum cleaned. In addition, the whole atmosphere of the room was rather cold and very far from the cosy rooms I have gotten use to in other hotels of this type/price level (for example the Aston hotel in London). The lighting was insufficient, there was no water kettle to make coffee/tea (standard in most boutique hotels), and the TV was a small PC screen which had seen better days. Another big minus was that the PC down in the reception area had an internet connection slower than anything I have experienced in recent years (even in Eastern Europe), and when I pointed out to the hotel reception that I could not even access my email to check my departure flight, they were again quick to offer Hotel Opera as an alternative..I tried to point out that as far as I book and pay to stay at a specific hotel, I am not really interested in having to rely on another one to provide the services I require, but they did not seem to understand. In general, although the reception staff was forthcoming, they did not possess the kind of information we would expect. When we asked them to recommend a good Asian restaurant, they suggested Italian (...), and when we asked for good quality shopping (small boutiques, Spanish design), they suggested one of the typical high streets. I think some it may be explained by insufficient languages skills/difficulties in understanding, but still, it did not help the overall experience. Finally, the breakfast was just as good as expected from other reviews, but again, the juice glasses were. without exception, dirty (surely only superficially rinsed in hot water) and even the plates bore occassional traces of food. All in all, I came home after a four days stay with swollen eyes (from dust allergy), a desire to take a shower, and to go to bed in clean sheets, and that is not how I expect to feel after a week-end break. I have stayed at a variety of hotels in the same category in the last 3-4 months, in Athens, Bratislava, Tallinn and London, and they all offered much better value for money.

About half a block away from the Opera metro stop and a few minutes from several major attractions. Yet it is on a quiet residential-ish street that makes you feel like you are really in Madrid and not tourist-land. Rooms--the rooms are small (typical), but modern, stylish and extremely clean. Beautifully decorated. A little flat-screen tv on the wall that gets a couple English stations (for your siesta). I believe there is also a sound system and wifi, but I did not use either during my stay. One of the best bathrooms I've ever had traveling in Europe. Modern, relatively large, and they give you products. Beds weren't great, but were not oppressive either. You won't get views from this hotel, my room overlooked an airshaft at the back of the hotel, but this wasn't an issue for me. I think at best you would face the street, which is small and relatively quiet. Hotel Amenities--there is a public computer, which I was able to use to get online without any trouble or having to wait. A small lounge, but no restaurant. The hotel serves breakfast (a large buffet) in a dining room downstairs. Pretty standard options, fruit, tortilla, cereals, coffee, juice, pastries. There is a convenience store up the block where you can buy water, snacks, etc. There is not really a market or food stand nearby. THe building is (I believe) a 19th century building, but in excellent condition. They have a beautiful original staircase.

Palacio Real is a 2 minute walk; the Prado is 15-20. The front desk staff was quite helpful and friendly, offering good advice even in response to some rather off-the-wall questions. No doorman and a couple of steps up to the reception area. We did not always speak to front desk staff in English but when we did, their English was excellent. We had small rooms on the second floor (207 and 202, I think) with windows opening onto an interior courtyard. Interior noise dampening within the hotel was good to very good. Rooms were much like what you would expect from a mid-range boutique hotel in NYC: compact square footage, streamlined modern furnishings, very clean, with comfortable, good-quality bedding. Unlike some reviewers, we experienced no trouble at all adjusting the climate control to keep the rooms warm. The lobby includes a reading area, communal bookshelf, DVD library, and a desktop with internet access. Breakfast was good to very good and included in our room rate. Ample buffet with a wide variety: coffee, mineral water, orange, peach, and pineapple juice, fresh fruits, cold cuts and cheese, sliced bread and a variety of rolls, cereal, yogurt, tortilla espanola, churros, an abundant selection of cakes, and a few hot things in chafing dishes like bacon and scrambled eggs. I read a few negative reviews of the breakfast and agree with only one point: the cups, glasses and cutlery could use a more vigorous dishwashing. Most days the four of us encountered at least one item with something stuck or caked on. It is true most of the food is not hot, and Meninas definitely appears to be operating without its own full kitchen, but the the temperatures were fine. Most items on the menu were intended to be served at room temperature, including the tortilla. Sure, it would have been nice to have churros straight out of a deep fryer, but that's not the deal here. Once we did encounter a slice of stale bread at the end of a row, but we just took the next slice in. The dining room is on the basement level but we did not find it dark or claustrophobic at all.

There was a huge double wardrobe, lots of storage space, tv, dvd player etc. The bed was one of the most comfortable bed's i've slept in! the bathroom was lovely too, although the seal around the shower clearly needed replacing as was really grubby looking, however the shower as a whole was clean. There were a few water marks on the ceiling in the bathroom, and an hour before our departure, we noticed water dripping through the ceiling. The buffet breakfast was excellent, with lots of choice. Lots of different breads and bread rolls, scrambled and boiled eggs, sausages, bacon etc. Plenty of cereal and fresh fruit and an amazing array of caked pastries and juices. The location was also really good, a few minutes walk takes you to the royal palace, the plaza mayor and the prado to name but a few. I'd recommend not eating in or around the plaza mayor as the places were generally very touristy and a bit overpriced. Have a walk through the streets and you'll find something nicer elsewhere.

We had a sofa bed and table in our room, ensuite shower room (larger rooms have baths I believe), desk, wardrobe and two single beds. The room had 2 large windows, and felt bright and airy. The decor is simple yet pleasant. The breakfasts are served from 7am-11am, which is great if you are business (or on holiday and only crawling in at 4am!) They provide continental style breads and pastries, lots of fresh fruit, cooked eggs, bacon, sausage, cereals etc. We always tanked up on breakfast, which kept us going for most of the day! We booked through the hotel website, which ensures your breakfast is included, whereas if you book through Expedia, breakfast is often not included and is 15 euro each. You can hear the Metro passing underneath in the basement breakfast room, so if you are a light sleeper, ask for an upper floor room. There is wifi in the rooms and a PC in the lobby area where you can check emails, flights etc if you don't have your laptop with you. The hotel is located between Opera and Orient and is therefore very central. We walked everywhere and didn't even need to use the Metro. From Opera Metro station, turn out of the steps to the right and follow round the (current) construction site between the safety boards on Plaza de Isabelle II and the theatre. Carry on up Calle de Camponanes (the street straight ahead, which slopes slightly upwards), and Meninas is about half way up the road. You can walk round the other way past Burger King, but it is slightly longer. Meninas' sister hotel, Hotel Opera, has a spa/sauna that guests are welcome to use (but we didn't get time to use it). The staff were very helpful and spent a lot of time showing us where to go on a map and also printed our boarding passes for us so we could check in quickly and spend more time in Madrid on our departure day.

Quite a few minutes went by and I could hear she wasn't talking to any one and just put my phone on the desk, I said hello for several times but she didn't answer. I was calling from overseas costing a lot so I hung up and called again, as soon as she heard that it was me again she hung up without saying anything, then I kept calling for at least 12 times ( not exaggerating) and she hung up every single time. At last a man picked up, so I talked to him and he transfered to the lady again. I said \"please don't hang up\" for 3 times and finally she talked. She didn't speak English well, I had to say the same things several times, and spelled my name 3 times. Finally she changed my reservation on Saturday. I had her repeat my final reservation and she even said \"don't worry, it is fine now.\" I made an mistake didn't get her name and ended the call. When I arrived, they told me I was being charged because of no show, and of course my reservation was canceled. Turned out she never changed my reservation. I explained the situation and they told me it was not possible because they didn't accept any change of reservation via phone, every employee knew that so I must be wrong. I told them exactly when I called, what happened, and they just kept saying it was not possible, and refused to tell me who was the lady that day.

I arrived, and was given the last room in the hotel, which was directly one floor up from the street, directly above reception/entrance, and only a non-enclosed shower with a promise I could move in the AM. I tried the room-the noise was unbelievable-alternating between football match cheering and disco-directly outside. I'd spent a long work week prior with little sleep, and begged to move to another hotel. Was told I could for one night but then would have to move back to a different room.
