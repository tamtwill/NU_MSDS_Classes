The staff is extremely friendly. The average rating is almost entirely due to the set up of the room and the amenities in it. I stay at Courtyards whenever there is one near my business or recreation. I have never actually seen a Courtyard that doesn't have a refrigerator and microwave in the room. That is one of the main reasons I choose them over some cheaper hotels. When you are staying in a place for several days, it is such a nice amenity to be able to keep stuff cold or make some microwave popcorn. Anyway, this Courtyard does not have either of those things in the room. I was able to request a refrigerator, and they happened to have one available, so that was good. I guess I have just come to expect that as a standard at courtyards. Also, this room had only one mirror and the outlet by this mirror didn't work. I don't care about that, since I have no hair. :-) My wife and daughter, however, did not like this at all. The housekeeping on our floor was also substandard. They did the minimum, I thought.

We had a double queen room overlooking the pool area. Enjoyed sitting out on the balcony, which had 2 chairs and a small table). The room was nice and roomy and offered free wi-fi. Was disappointed there was no mini-fridge. But otherwise the room was a typical Courtyard Marriott room. Ate breakfast one morning in the downstairs lounge/dining area. They offer a standard buffet or a cooked to order breakfast with very limited choices. The wait staff was attentive and friendly and the food was nothing fancy but well prepared. My only complaint is that the guests in the room next to us came in at 1:30 AM one night. Turned on their music quite loudly and were themselves loud. After 30 minutes it became apparent they were not \"settling in\" for the night. I called the front desk, for at this point my whole family was awake and unable to sleep past the noise. The front desk sent a night watchman up to check it out. Then at about 2:15 we heard the phone in the next room ring and expected the music to go off and things to quiet down. This was not the case. The people cranked up the music and partied until about 4:30 AM. That morning after breakfast I told the front desk woman about our experience and she pretty much shrugged it off. Which is why I give this otherwise good hotel an average rating. Customer service should have been at least apologetic or something! Especially in consideration that I'm a Marriott GOLD member and loyally stay at Marriott hotels.

It\u2019s on the outskirts of Chandler (off Route 101, 20 mins from airport)) and appears to cater to the nearby businesses as opposed to the leisure traveler. There is a hallway that joins the two hotels, either side can check you in. The CY has their new modern look (bistro, etc), the Fairfield is of the Inn and Suites variety. I stayed there3 nights and noticed that the Fairfield desk clerk is not there late at night & early morning, and a sign directs you to the CY desk. Free breakfast at Fairfield, you pay at the CY. Free USA Today but no Wall Street Journal. Fast internet, limited TV channels (40). There are no restaurants within walking distance but dozens within 10-15 minutes, lots of upscale shopping as well. Rooms (as well as both hotels in general) were in excellent shape, very clean and comfortable. Nice exercise room and decently sized pool. In back of the hotel is hundreds of acres of flat land, apparently ready for development some day. Not really much else around the hotel. If you\u2019re a jogger, there is a dirt trail behind the property. I stay in the Phoenix area a lot and have found that these hotels are amongst the most inexpensive Marriott properties, when there is seasonal high hotel demand (like Jan-March). This is likely because they\u2019ve built these properties in advance and in expectation of higher business demand, which is not at the moment. During the summer months, most of the Marriott properties drop their rates and its feasible to even get an upscale resort type property for under $100.

The front desk staff is friendly enough, although the desk itself is in a very strange location that forces customers to walk down and around, through construction and equipment. It also places the counter at roughly chest level or higher, making one feel like a child begging for a cookie from mommy. But that's not the reason for the review title.... I was dead tired and starting to get sick, and I wanted a nice hot bath and a little television. The bathtub was dirty (I could feel it against my skin), and the television didn't work. I was just too tired to care. Next morning, I flushed the toilet and watched as it flooded the entire room with 1-1/2\" of filthy water, including someone else's cigarette butt. Some of my belongings were involved in the muck. They moved me to another room, but that room was still either occupied or not yet cleaned after a check-out. There were used....well, I don't want to know....on the night table and towels everywhere. I was finally moved to yet another room that had just been renovated less than a week earlier. This room not only had no toilet paper, but not even a toilet paper HOLDER! There was already a mould problem in the shower, and I was likely the first person to have stayed in this room since it was renovated. There was no full-length mirror anywhere in the room.
