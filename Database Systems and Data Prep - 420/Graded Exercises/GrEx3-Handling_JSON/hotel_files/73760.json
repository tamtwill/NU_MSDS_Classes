I have never stayed in such a filthy, disgusting and RUDE place in my life! I wouldn't stay here if it were FREE!!! We went here for a short one night trip to Phoenix while we were looking for apartments to rent out and nothing worked! We made a complaint to the manager (and then had to call customer service who did NOTHING!) about the facility because of the rude service we encountered when we informed them of the numerous long, red hairs (I have brown hair!) that were found in our towels and cold shower that I had to take because the water wasn't working. The manager then went on to say that \"they were embedded in the wash.\" I uploaded pictures of the towels but we'll see if they post them. They were not embedded but rather picked up from the ground and re-folded after the previous guest used them. The company stands behind certain \"standers\" and the first core value that was stated on their \"plaque\" of promises wasn't upheld. We didn't receive the \"warm hospitality and clean comfortable rooms where everything work[ed]\" and even though our expectations were not met, [our] needs [were not met] in a timely manner\" (Days Inn Promise from plaque). They gave me a measly 25% discount and mocked me when I demanded my money back.

I also only went in the bathroom and shower in my flip flops...I'm not picky but the floor was so yucky looking. The toilet took 3 flushes to clear itself, and the instructions on how to use the confusing shower made no sense. My blanket had some sort of yellowish brown statins all over it, and my moms had ciragrette burns on it. Our night was not very restful either due to the constant slamming of doors and loud talking from rooms up and down the hallway and below us in the parking lot. I also heard a very loud scream in the hallway at 3 am. The \"breakfast\" in the morning contained nothing but sliced bread from the grocery store laid out to look pretty and Cheerios...we went to McDonalds instead.

I traveled from Ohio with my mother to visit my Aunt in the hospital. I chose this hotel for its low rates to be honest. That being said, they gave me a discount because of visiting someone sick in hospital. For the price I could not expect the \"Hilton\". I felt the elevator and the hallway smelled like a cigar. Did not like that, however once in my room I turned on the air and after a few minutes it was better. The convenience to the light rail system was great. I walked less than a block to catch it and had to walk 2 blocks to get to the hospital. That saved me a lot of money. The security at the hospital would even pick me up and bring me back if needed or if I stayed after dark. That was awesome. The continental breakfast was just ok and I did eat it a few days. However for a small fee of $3.99 plus tax you can get an upgrade to any item on the breakfast menu. Between my mom and I we tried most of these breakfasts. They were very delicious and the waiter was absolutely awesome. He is a very, very nice man and very courteous and helpful.( I do not know his name but would like to Thank Him very much) He would ask about my Aunt everyday. That was a special touch. Thank you very much for that ! The bed was comfortable. When I needed something I would ask and I got it. So, it is an unexspensive hotel. Do not come here expecting way more than you pay for. However, if you need to visit someone in St. Joseph and can not spend an arm and a leg I would suggest you use this hotel. If you are looking for a resort, maybe not. However, even though I did not get to use the pool, I did sit by it and it was nice. The laundry was convienient and the fitness room was ok.

The ticket machine gives change by the way, all in dollar coins. This option is feasible if you don't have too much luggage and it's not too heavy. I stayed here both at the start and end of my vacation and rented a car from Enterprise just along the road, and you pay far less in city tax if you hire a car from a location outside the airport, so this is a good location in this respect also.

I'm sure management could resolve all the issues we noticed if they put a little TLC into the property. First, the pool area was lovely, it is one of the rare hotel pools that is not only large, but also deep, reaching 10 feet. The hot tub was also large. But here is the problem, the palm trees in the courtyard have not been groomed and maintained, and therefore pigeons roost in the palms. There were droppings all around the pool area, and feathers everywhere, including the pool and hot tub. Nasty. Determined to get in the hot tub after a long drive we fished out the feathers and proceeded to get in. The jets appeared to be plugged and wouldn't work properly, and the water stunk. Let me say again, this was a real shame because the pool is a very nice area, but it certainly needs attention. Our room was spacious, comfortable and relatively clean. It even had a mini fridge. But, the shower would not drain. When we took our showers after the stinky hot tub experience, and then again in the morning, the water just collected in the tub until we were standing in half a foot of tepid shower water. So again, this is troublesome because just a little maintenance would resolve this unpleasant issue. Over all, I would not go so far as to give this property a 'terrible' rating, but I will not be staying there again unless I hear management has evicted the pigeons and unclogged the drains.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, NV", "Title": "\u201cGreat location BUT!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "LVBeachlover", "ReviewID": "UR118001757", "Content": "The Days Inn Camelback has a Great location and a very nice staff BUT..

The Ugly: -Toilet often had to be flushed repeatedly to fully evacuate waste. -Noise from street or other guests isn't very well insulated against. -This trip there were parties and slamming doors happening all hours of the night (even at 4 AM) and staff members (while friendly and sympathetic) weren't very effective in resolving noise complaints.

My son swam in the pool the night of our stay and it was clean. At the time we were the only ones at the pool. I also saw a few families using it in the morning while we ate our breakfast.

I arrived to find my King room not ready (after posted check-in time). The front desk clerk was friendly and made it right by upgrading me to a King Suite. This room was ENORMOUS. It was fairly sparsely furnished, but everything was clean and in line with what I expected for what I paid. I knew another guest who had a King room like I had booked. He also said his room was large and quite adequate for the price. The furniture was poorly planned and sparse in my opinion. The desk had one outlet you would have had to climb under to reach (outlet had no plate/cover). Since the desk was on wheels, I moved it in front of a window (where it should be in my opinion) to get a good view of the pool area and be near an accessible outlet. There was a HUGE space next to the bed where there should be a chair.

I called the front desk and was abruptly told that is was my fault that I had the sign on. Every other hotel I stayed at will come back to see if the sign has been removed and make up the room. No clean towels, shampoo or coffee was delivered to the room when I returned I the evening. 2. While is is nice to allow pets, guest should not be allowed to have their pets in the pool area. One day a guest took his dog onto the grass and allowed his dog to urinate on it. Children were playing in that area a few hours earlier. 3. The lounge chairs at the pool have bird excrement on them.

The room layout was a bit funky as it was suppose to be a suite but there wasn't a door to separte the living room area from the bedroom. The bathroom was huge with two sinks. The showerhead was too low for the average person. Although we didn't use them there was a sink, fridge, microwave and coffee maker along with two tv's and a pull out sofa. The location to the lightrail was a very important factor in our choice. Very close by to the 7th Ave. and Camelback stop. The airport has a shuttle that takes you to the lightrail station and from there it's about a 30 minute trip on the train. The Bad: A dead coakroach on the floor in the bathroom, very noticeable dur to it's large size. Better dead than alive though! The maids need to be better as there was also a nasty towel under our bed and a tissue behind a shelf unit. The elevators really needed to be vaccumed out. They should also have more irons and ironing boards available. They are not in each room so it's first come first serve, we had to ask repeatedly. The Ugly: The view out our second floor room was of the ac units. The property itself is not very attractive from the outside. Overall the value is what makes this hotel worth a recommendation. We were very happy with the price we paid for what we received. I understand that Days Inn just acquired the property so hopefully they take care of the issues and leave the price alone.", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value, Nice Pool.\u201d", "Author": "DALBoston", "ReviewID": "UR33067374", "Content": "This hotel is now a Days Inn property.

Try to stay on the poolside of the buildings and the upper two floors of the south building as the second floor of the south building overlooks the roof and obscures any view of the pool.
