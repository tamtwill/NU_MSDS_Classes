The room that I stayed in was ok and could have been a little cleaner. The bed sheets looked rather worn out, but, the bed was comfortable. The TV is not flat screen and the reception was not all that great. One of the big pluses is that I had a microwave oven and small fridge which came in handy. The A/C is rather noisy, but, works just fine and kept my room comfortable. Would I stay at this hotel again? The answer is no. There are a lot more hotel choices around this area that look more promising although a bit more expensive.

We spent our last night in this hotel. Thankfully it was the last night and not the first. We arrived at 10:30pm to check in a group of 44. The girl at the front desk was very nice and efficient. After that things went downhill quickly. The hotel consists of 2 buildings. We were in the second building. I suspect that the few good reviews were from people who stayed in the main building. The 2-story building we stayed in reminded me of something that should have been condemned. When we arrived in 102-degree weather the Air conditioning in the hallways was turned off. We figure no big deal; our rooms will be cool. Well the air conditioning in all the rooms was turned off. This did not make sense, they knew we were coming you would have thought the rooms would be prepared. Some of the rooms never cooled down. I was fortunate that the room I was in did cool down by morning. So I was able to shower comfortably. When walking the halls trying to find our way to the lobby (which you could not get to without leaving the building) to get extra towels we noticed that the steps to the second floor were closed down and blocked off. There was also one room in the hall, which had the yellow and black police caution tape on the door and a boarded up sliding glass door out to the parking lot. Each room had a sliding glass door to the outside. Some of these led to a very unsafe parking lot. Fortunately the student travel company I used provided nighttime security officers. As the other reviews have said the sheets and towels were very dingy and everything was in very poor repair. I would definitely never stay here again and would avoid Days Inns wherever possible. On our tour we stayed at 2 Days Inns and 2 Laquintas. The Days Inns were both awful whereas the Laquintas were fine. Since I did not have control over the hotels I am glad I did not read these reviews beforehand. But if you are considering this hotel I would recommend avoiding it if at all cost. There is a Laquinta across the street, which looked much nicer.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cWe got exactly what we paid for.\u201d", "Author": "mello1441", "ReviewID": "UR26746264", "Content": "We booked a trip trough Expedia.

I found the light switch in the bathroom, and the first thing I noticed when I turned on the light was a beefy cockroach on his back, legs in the air, wiggling around like a dog wanting his belly scratched. This thing was huge! The inconvenient part was that I stayed for three nights - each day my room key would stop working, and I would have to walk to the office to get it reset- usually it was while I was laying out by the pool, so I'd have to trudge down the hall in my wet shorts and wait in the lobby scaring the poor families checking in who had to look at my hairy back. I asked the front desk clerk is there a problem why this keeps happening, and one of them said \"it's because they're cheap!\" I assume they meant the owners or management. The pool area wasn't bad, nice and clean, kind of an older place but kept really clean. The furniture, carpets, etc., are pretty old and way outdated, the place could really use a freshening up.

I was moved to a room by the freeway where the wi-fi did work, but this move was the beginning of a nightmare which plagued the visit right up until I left the following Thursday. Each day when I returned from meetings my room key had been deactivated, every day. The explanation I heard most frequently was that when I was moved to a different room, the person at the desk had not made the proper entry in the computer. Each day I made an attempt to straighten this out. At one point, I was not in the computer at all. One of the desk clerks, Angel, promised each day to research and fix the problem, but he never did. He kept saying he needed the manger's assistance but that she was sick and in a \"hate the world\" mood. Minor inconveniences: The room did not have a coffee pot, so when I asked for one I was brought a coffee pot but no coffee. The pot itself had the incorrect lid and had to be manually pressed up against the coffee container to prevent the hot water from building up inside. Since I was not in the computer I did not receive maid service until Wednesday. When I ordered Chinese food, the lady who finally delivered it told me she had been given a card key to get into the building but it did not work. When the room card would not work Wednesday night, I went to the office and asked for someone to explain why it had been deactivated each and every day. At this point I was afraid to leave my room for ice. The sick manager was at the computer that night. Although I was not even speaking to her directly, she interjected the following: \"Well, sir, we don't change the codes once we make the card!\" After searching long and hard, the only word I can use to describe her tone is this one: hateful. I suppose I should have slept in my car instead of bothering her. If the hotel is not responsible for making sure guests have reliable access to their rooms, who is? The worse worry, however, was that when I checked out none of the people who are familiar with the problem would be working. When I went into the lobby to check, sure enough, only the friendly manager was there and a lady I had never seen before. So I just left...
