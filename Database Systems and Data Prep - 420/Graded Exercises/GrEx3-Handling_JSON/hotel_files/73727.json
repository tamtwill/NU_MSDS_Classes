It was not until when I went to check in after a day of travelling that I was informed. Kim at the front desk was wonderful, got Cheap Tickets on the phone for me, looked at their listing on their website and ensured a refund. I did stay for one night since it was so late by that time. It appears to have been a grand hotel in its day. There were many maintenance issues reported as I stood at the front desk on hold with Cheap Tickets for 1/2 an hour and then for another 1/2 hour once I finallly got a person. (I will review Cheap Tickets in a separate one) The staff at the hotel were very accomodating and attended to the maintenance issues quickly, I believe that they had their hands full. The pool area was gorgeous. There are elevators. The rooms have balconies, but without tables or chairs. The rooms have a fridge and a microwave. I never did get any hot water in the bathroom sink, and was only able to have a bath after getting some help getting a plug and some instructions on how to get water in the bath (turn more than 5 times). I was given a cable to hook up to internet in my room, but I was able to get a bar of wifi in there in which to search for another hotel. Kim saved the day.

The room was provided for me by the people who hired me that day, so I wasn't going to complain. The lobby is kind of nice and the room is... average. About what I'd expect. The problem here is that there were a lot of little things that add up to give it a not-so-great review. There was no info in the room that told me the check out time or any of the amenities or things available at the hotel. I found that I kept having to call the desk with questions, and while the person working there was nice enough, they weren't terribly helpful or enthusiastic. It seemed like they didn't like their job that much. I called to ask about getting the internet and was told that WiFi was available in the lobby. I said I was surprised that they didn't have it in the rooms, and she said that they did, but I'd need to come down to the lobby and pick up a cable to plug into the wall. I thought it odd that I would have to throw a few questions her way to finally draw out that information. The bar was large, but they were doing karaoke for a small group of people (pretty bad) the night I was there, so I didn't hang out in the bar. The next morning, I went to have breakfast in their restaurant, where they advertise the $4 breakfast. The service was pretty bad. Like they didn't want to be there. And it felt pretty warm in the restaurant too. I suppose this might not be a problem during the winter, but it was pretty lame during the summer. This wasn't just limited to the restaurant... In the room, I couldn't get the AC to cool the room down enough for my taste. It was over 100 degrees outside, and it was like the room couldn't get any cooler than the mid to upper 70's. To Arizonans, that probably feels great, but it's still a little warm for me to sleep. Fortunately, I had an electric fan in the trunk of my car, so I brought that in and it helped. The pillows were the heavy kind, that almost feel hard. Not terribly comfortable. The bed itself was ok, and the TV was ok but there was no guide to the channels or any other literature, for that matter. No complaints about the bathroom or shower. They had only 2 luggage carts, both of which didn't exactly roll great. I got to use one to check in, but naturally, at check out time, they were nowhere to be found. I'm a musician and I had a couple of guitars, an amp, a cooler and a couple of suitcases with other touring merch & clothes, so a cart was really needed, but I had to get going. Without the cart, this would take at least 3 trips. So I took one load down and on the way back in from the car, the woman at the front desk offered me a different kind of cart meant more for the kitchen or housekeeping staff to get my stuff together for check out. That was pretty cool of her to lend me the other kind of cart, but when I got back upstairs to my room the key card didn't work anymore. It was 10 minutes prior to checkout time. AAUUGGHHH!!!! I had to go all the way back down the hall, catch the slow elevator and go to the front desk for them to reactivate the key. Really annoying. On my way back up to the room, I passed a family in the hallway that had been locked out of their room too. The staff acted like this inconvenience was completely normal and to be expected. I can't recall that happening to me anywhere else. After that, I got everything on the cart and made as quick an exit as I could. Again... not completely horrible, but the little annoyances really added up. I suppose I'd still stay there again if the room is provided for me, but at least I'd know going in what the problems were. I probably wouldn't choose to stay here if I was spending my own money, though.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cCheap Grand Canyon vacation\u201d", "Author": "sleeslee84", "ReviewID": "UR115737887", "Content": "Very out dated inn but great for the poor college student--it's clean but definitely not pleasing to the eye.

Some of the exterior lights on the building were also burned-out, or flickering, giving the whole place a creepy feeling. Going up to the room the elevator made odd clunking noises, and when the elevator doors opened the hallway looked quite depressing, and had a musty smell. The room itself was tired and not completely clean - It is a place where you consider wearing socks to bed because you don't want to walk on the carpet in bare feet.

We have had 2 Regional Conferences at the Grace Inn over the last several years and I must say that both the management and the staff have been the most accommodating that our disability group has ever encountered. First - when we were searching for a conference location several years ago it was like pulling teeth for every little thing we needed - all the other hotels were either totally unaccommodating or added a hefty price to any and all extras (that were not extras at all in our world). Our group is also non-profit, and the Grace Inn literally bent over backwards to accommodate all of our needs at no additional cost - infact - they gave us an awesome group rate and maintained that same rate years later (even though the cost of living had increased). Second - the professionalism of the Grace Inn included impeccable service while also providing incredibly personable, warmth and sincerity. Everyone bent over backwards to accommodate our group - from the front desk to catering to banquet to restaurant to housekeeping to security to management. Special needs required extra effort on everyone's part - it was given willingly and appreciated tremendously. Third - the banquet facilities were perfect for our group, the pool and surrounding area was clean and inviting, and the rooms were tidy and comfortable. The layout of the Grace Inn also provided excellent cozy areas for various subgroups to congregate - from the cozy firepit area to the fun seating around the water feature to the comfy seating on the second floor balcony to the relaxing seating around the pool.

Even after the iffy reviews I really hoped to enjoy my stay. From the outside and the lobby I was hopeful & the clerk who checked me in was friendly and efficient. The room was fine, furnishings showing some age but adequate. It annoys me when people get a cheap room and bitterly complain about not having a 5-star atmosphere--if you want that, pay for it! My needs were simple and everything was fine. The bathroom was spotless which is a bonus in an older hotel. There was a small balcony where I enjoyed my morning coffee but wish there had been a chair. I was happy to see a little coffeemaker and fridge--always a big plus! The free wireless internet was very slow to connect and then none-too-speedy, but it was adequate for my needs. So I was feeling pretty good about everything. That's when things started going downhill. First, when I got to my room that evening it was very chilly and adjusting the thermostat to a warmer temp just seemed to inspire the ac to blow colder. I hate \"idiot\" buttons. If they aren't going to allow us to adjust the temp, don't put a thermostat on the wall to give the illusion that we can control it. We'll KNOW it's not working. Finally I was able to just shut off the fan and hope it didn't get too warm overnight. And it was fine. The room was quiet, the bed comfortable and I slept like a baby. I turned the ac back on in the morning and all was well, but I should have been able to adjust it to a more comfortable temp that evening. In the morning, I was glad for the coffeemaker but annoyed that there was no creamer at all. Oh well... I made do without. Not the end of the world, likely just sloppy housekeeping. Then when I went to shower the knob to turn on the water was either stuck or broken. No amount of pulling, turning, twisting or prodding did the trick and when I pulled the front off the knob, I gave up. I could have gotten dressed again and I'm sure the hotel would have sent someone to fix it but in the interest of time, I didn't bother. I just washed as best I could in the sink and called it good enough. Why didn't housekeeping report the problem and have it fixed before putting someone in this room? Strike Three. Dang, I wanted to give the place a good review and if I got a good deal, I probably would stay again. I mean, what are the odds that I'd get a shower I couldn't turn on again???

I kind of felt like maybe I should have worn plastic flipflops in, like at the gym or something. the \"mountain view rooms\" afford lovely views of the McDonald's, gas station, and the strip mall across the street. I could see the highway from my balcony, and watch the bikers smoking in the hotel parking lot as they geared up for their ride. someone woke me up having a party at about 3am. not exactly a classy place. bring your own soap and shampoo as there's is the crummy motel kind. the air con controller looks like it is from 1970--no lie. the carpet frightened me too; it may have been cleaned once or twice but it seemed old and was just gross. the room was good-size and didn't *appear* to be dirty--thats the best I can say. I tipped housekeeping b/c its not their fault the rooms are old and dingy; they can only do so much. It's close to the airport, which is why I stayed there. But the room was so gross, I spent the whole night out until it was time to go to sleep, and I did that finally with great reluctance. it wasn't the grossest room I ever stayed in, maybe like the 2nd grossest, next to a highway-side \"inn\" I got stuck at once. another plus is that at least there were no bed bugs. spend another $50 and find somewhere nice. it's worth staying further away from the airport and getting up an hour early. trust me.", "Date": "March 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cmore like a motel than a hotel\u201d", "Author": "pkPortland", "ReviewID": "UR23963565", "Content": "The Grace Inn is in serious need of remodeling and upgraded services if it wants to be \"the premier choice among Phoenix Hotels and Resorts\" (as they say on their website).

There was no description of amenities or services in the room so I was calling the front desk every time I had a question such as to find out if there is internet in the rooms (only some rooms). When the AC/heat fan starting making a loud, clanging noise at 10pm, I was told I would just have to wait until morning to have it fixed.

Seemed like it could have a nice cleaning. Our room was somehow connected to another room (which we didn't want or realize at first. Our first night there no one was in the room next to us, but the next night people were there).That it made it very uncomfortable when we could hear and see the shadows of the peoples feet next to us under the door. It's a good thing they weren't doing anything, (at least we couldn't hear) uggghhh! otherwise we would have asked to switch rooms immediately.

First, the good parts... The public areas at the hotel were really quite nice, and the conference rooms had the unique feature of opening on to the pool/patio area. With absolutely fabulous weather, we had those doors open all day and night, and it was such a nice departure from the usual, closed in, conference atmosphere. The pool area was quite nice and it looked like the restroom in the lobby had been recently remodeled. Now for the not so good... The rooms needed some updating BADLY. It was a sparcely furnished, huge room with a flat, planklike bed, a small sofa and a chair, a desk and a TV cabinet, and even with all of that in there, the place seemed cavernously empty. Old, OLD drapes and bedspread, and in that whole humongous room, one teeny little picture on the wall made it look uncomfortably spartan. The whole room slanted towards one wall, and one morning when I opened up my drapes a bit past the window, I found a huge crack in the wall. Seems like the whole place is on it's way to toppling! My friends had a room that slanted even more than mine... one of them had trouble staying on her bed without sliding out. Another friend had a shower head that was hanging off the wall. On arrival, the main elevators in the lobby weren't working and it took most of the next day for them to be fixed... so we had to use the freight elevator to get our stuff up to our rooms. The restaurant takes the prize for the world's worst breakfast buffet and service. One morning I sat there for 20 minutes and no one even came around for a drink order. No coffee... thank heavens I was able to scrounge some up at the conference. If you're attending a conference, there really isn't too much in the way of lodging close by... there's a hotel accross the highway, but it's a very busy highway, sort of like a freeway, actually, so it wouldn't really be convenient to stay elsewhere. There are, however, several restaurants within walking distance.
