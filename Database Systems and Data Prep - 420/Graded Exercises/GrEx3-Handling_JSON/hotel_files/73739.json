Based on the reviews (cleanness and great breakfast) is why I went with it. I'm not super picky in other areas, that's mainly what I look for, BUT BIG MISTAKE for ignoring other \"cons\" mentioned.... Room: first the room was clean but more like a \"remodel\" type of clean looks like walls were painted over and you could still see the dirt under the paint. Sinks looked like they didn't use a good cleaner and just wasn't very clean, it was more of a surface clean. A couple of people mentioned it being small. Well it was tiny and hard to even change with privacy. There was no room around the sink, the only door was to the toilet and shower and then to go out. It is way to crammed for a family. The beds were comfortable and they had good selection of towels. I liked that they gave you an option to pick your services everyday. Breakfast: I liked it and I'd say that was very good: homemade waffles, sausage, gravy, biscuits, a lot of toast, eggs, hash browns, cereal, oatmeal, coffee, juice-it was excellent but the same everyday and it was a little small and crowded. Staff was very nice and helpful with breakfast. Front desk people were not very helpful but nothing worth complaining about. Not good: the walls were so thin I could literally hear the neighbor \"peeing\" in his restroom in the very early of the morning, we could here when someone took a shower (water turning on and running) we could also hear all the people outside (talking, walking, driving) plus the windows did not lock. The property was beautiful and the location and pool was pretty great, easy to get around.

The 2 queen beds are in the same bedroom so the other couple may have to sleep on the sofabed if you do not wish to share the bedroom (better to know before you go). There is only a small typical hotel room table and 3 chairs, so for eating the meals you have cooked all together can cause a certain logistic problem. The kitchenet is not fully equiped. The kitchen tools are very basic, very small stove, no oven. For pots and pan, ask at the desk because they do not let them in the suite because people steal them.

We didnt have a day that was warm enough to use the pool, but it looked inviting and clean. Now, my impression of the suite was a bit disappointing, due to how tiny it was. I think they took regular sized hotel rooms and divided them into a sitting room with a bedroom with a door, keeping the bathroom to divide the two areas. It was clean, but we could barely walk around the queen sized bed. A plus was the two flat screen tvs. The breakfast was better than most, with hot entrees, but they were the same choices evey day.

After sleeping one night at another property in Phoenix that was a horrible experience I vowed that I would find another hotel that would be to my satisfaction; trust me when I tell you that my expectations of a Best Western stay were far surpassed at the Northern Avenue property. It was easy to find, the front desk personnel were very pleasant and actually glad to have you as a guest! The small suite they put me in was on the second floor away from Northern Avenue traffice and had a refreshing view of the Squaw Peak mountain with an elevation of 2608 feet, which by the way CAN be climbed if you are in for a good hike. If you cannot climb the stairs then stay on the first floor as there is not an elevator, but even tired from lack of sleep the night before I managed a small suitcase, laptop bag and my \"jumbo sized\" travel purse just fine. As I approached the door of the suite and inserted the key and fippedvon the light I knew I had discovered an economic jewel! The outer sitting area had a nice desk with a halogen lamp for plug in laptops...you heard me a halogen lightbulb! But those of you who are modern techies with WI-FI you just need to sit down on the sofa/sleeper and log in. Unlike the other property who advertised free high speed internet, but could not deliver a connection lasting more than a few minutes, the Best Western delivered true high speed internet and it was consistent the 3 days I stayed! There was also a nice flat screen TV mounted on the wall above the desk AND another one in the bedroom on the wall across from the bed...who would have imagined that somebody actually thought about WHERE a guest would watch tv. There was a small refrigerator and a microwave. The bathroom had a clean shower with good water pressure and hot water throughout my shower and yes, being a girl I like my shower in the morning so it was not a quick one! They give you a nice supply of linens and will change them daily if you wish. The vanity top was a lovely granite and the sink did not back up with water like a lot of them do when you brush your teeth! The sink had nice lighting for make up application or shaving for the gentlemen. The bedroom had the most comfortable mattress and very feather soft pillows as well as a set of firmer ones, so they thought about keeping every guest comfortable. There was a very thoughtful lap tray if you need to sit in bed and work on any writing or computing. There was also a whirlpool tub and though I did not take a soak...let me say that this would have been the first whirlpool that I actually considered getting into! I was impressed with how clean the housekeeping staff kept everything. They also thought of all the little things you might need like a bottle of water AT NO CHARGE, mints in the bedroom and on the refrigerator to welcome you and get this...their . board cover was clean! The place I stayed prior to coming to the Best Western had an ironing board cover that I had to put a towel on before I could press my skirt for a business meeting the next day. As far as the property goes - I got to park right outside my room which was convenient. The lobby has a business center with computers and printers and I know they also have some other equipment such as a copier and fax machine. There is a nice pool area with lounge chairs, and in addition to the pool there is a spa pool. By the pool there is an area of vending machines, coin operated washers and dryers and an ice machine. As far as breakfast..well, yes it was called continental, but I found it to be exception, not because it was INCLUDED, but because it was good. They had 2 kinds of juices, Starbucks coffee, cereal, toast, yogart, 3 hot dishes including scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage and hash browns. Hold onto your hat because after all that for a \"continental\" breakfast they also had 2 waffle makers so you could cook your own fresh, hot waffle and they even thought about those of us watching our diets because they offered regular and sugar-free syrup!

After about a half hour of going back and forth to the front desk to clarify what an executive king or queen suite was about, we finally found the suite we thought we booked online, and were courtiously moved by the staff. The warning here is buyer beware. While at the front desk, I did overhear the clerk on the phone with the website agent informing them that they had charged us the wrong price for the wrong room. I heard my name mentioned while they were confirming credit card charges, and saw a copy of my confirmation on the desk. This made me question if this website is charging more these days and skimming profits, booking inferior rooms at their customer's cost. When we moved, the room was nice, new clean and spacious. Nothing like the hole in the wall super cheapie room. The customer service was great and accomodating. No complaints on Best Western's end, just the online provider of the rooms. Beautiful pool, beautiful hotel, lovely area, close to the airport. Final bottom line. If you book at this hotel with an online website, bring your confirmation printed out with you, make sure you have the room you booked. I feel we were deceived by this onling website booking agent, which makes me wonder now why American Airlines has dropped them. Best bet is to book directly through this hotel. After checking their prices on their website, it turned out to be even cheaper in the end than the website agent.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat service from front desk.\u201d", "Author": "ecthurston", "ReviewID": "UR91908356", "Content": "Front desk staff made my trip.

On top of that these people turned on their tv so loud..unbelievable... This was very annoing since we were on our holiday, and didn't want to wake up at 7am, as were a lot of other people we talked to. Maybe the hotel should change the sign by the pool to 8.00 or so, and pay a little more attention to such \"noisy guests\" in the future, because this will keep other guests away, for sure.

Unfortunately, between the thin walls and having been given a room on the ground floor --we did not experience much quiet nor did we get much sleep. There was a family with children staying above us and the noise they created at all hours of the night was completely disruptive. It really is a shame because the bed and pillows were super comfortable and we could have had a great night sleep on both nights. I highly recommend that guests request a room on the second floor and away from the stairwell --if you're looking to minimize the exposure to noise. The person who checked us in knew that we were looking for a nice quiet getaway and she should have known better than to put us in a room on the first floor by the stairwell. Last but not least, I was unable to connect to their WIFI --very confusing because I take my laptop everywhere and I never have problems connecting to WIFIs. Would I stay here again? Maybe.

The desk clerk was checking my information in the computer and I asked her if there were any suites available as I had called the hotel a week before my arrival and and was assured that I could upgrade to a suite. She immediately began to yell that if I wanted an upgrade I would have to pay for it. When I went to my room, I took the AAA Tour Book back to the desk and showed her where it specifically stated that the reservation could be upgraded if a suite was available and it would be free of charge. The same desk clerk started to yell again stating that she had told me when I called that I could upgrade for a charge and that was \"her\" rules. In fact I had spoken to a gentleman when I had called the week before, I never spoke to a lady. I asked her why she was raising her voice and if this was the way she spoke to guests. She completely ignored me and just kept on yelling. I asked to speak to the manager and she told me she was the manager when in fact the manager's name was clearly displayed on the wall. She walked away from the desk and the manager came to assist me about 10 mins. later. This incident was very humiliating as other guests were present. I am writing this review because this kind of behavior was totally unacceptable and hopefully no other guests will be treated in this manner. Overall service was great and the staff as a whole were very courteous and helpful.", "Date": "October 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cConvenient and clean\u201d", "Author": "glbtrttr", "ReviewID": "UR5230019", "Content": "Have stayed in a wide range of hotels - 2 star to 5 star so generally I have my expectations managed. This BW was actually a little above expectations; part of that might have to do with the fact that we arrived fairly early to check in - around noon - and they had a room ready and \"upgraded\" us to a suite on the 7th floor. Now, it was a suite at a Best Western, but still nice to have the extra space. Convenient to downtown although with the light rail construction that's going on in and around the city, need to plan a little extra time. Plenty of extra parking although none of it is covered, so don't leave anything in your car if you're there over the summer or it will be cooked! Definitely also recommend the restaurant ZEN which is a couple miles north on Central Ave and recently opened. Fitness center is a bit of a joke, but the pool, although small, was clean and had ample seating (lounge chairs and tables).", "Date": "May 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Shouldercat", "ReviewID": "UR4966082", "Content": "Recently renovated rooms are above average -especially when you consider the price!

The room was extremely clean in every way! The maid staff was sure to keep it spotless and restocked every morning. The room had a microwave, coffemaker, hairdryer, bottled water replenished each day, a small fridge, the sheets and pillowcases very soft and new pillowtop matress was lovely. We did our laundry here and took advantage of the vending machines each night for snacks. Too cold for the pool and hot tub, but we saw family's taking advantage, looked really neat & clean. Best of all, the breakfast off the lobby is worth your while not to skip! Eggs, toast, hash browns, make your own waffle station, yogurt, coffee, cereal, the works! For excellent coffee, drive one block into corporate area for specialty shops, gas, great chinese food and banks. Lobby has 3 computers with internet access (beware the firewalls that keep you from checking email, had to find Barnes and Noble to check mine, only drawback) and a nice fireplace, staff is very helpful and friendly. Free maps at front desk and loads of direction help. The pictures on line don't do it justice, much nicer than we expected.

We were looking for a budget hotel and I got an awesome deal on the Best Western site. (49.00 a night) Good points: room was clean and comfortable what you would expect. NOTE: We traveled with a 2 year old and there was NO room for a crib/ playpen with the two queen beds. This proved problematic as she was in/out of bed!!! Therefore keep this in mind before you order two queens! GOOD: Free breakfast in AM - \"You make waffles\" yummy, lots of juice, cereal, and other goodies. Unfortunately the breakfast room was small and often cramped, as well you may have to wait for your turn at the waffle cooker. GOOD: Staff where polite and offered travel tips. GOOD: First Wed of month they have a free BBQ (Hamburgers) looked OK but we skipped it. NOT SO GOOD: Pool was not the cleanest - scum around edge of pool. Hot tub either bath tub temp. or too hot? Also pool is located around the parking lot...therefore not the most relaxing, private or scenic. NOT SO GOOD: no place to sit outside room. There is a little deck, and pool area but we had to stay close to our room when our daughter was sleeping. We sat on cement railing and were in the way of cleaning staff. ADVICE: If you are traveling with kids, especially young ones - stay at a resort with LOTS OF AMENITIES! You do not want to be putting kids in/out of hot cars trying to find a place to eat or an activity to do. NOT RELAXING! ALSO: Avoid Tempe Town lake - not much there! Water park at Zoo fun choice! Lots of shade! AVOID AT ALL COSTS: Forgot the name but it is a \"Cowboy\" steakhouse in the hills of Phoenix. They cut off ties and hang them from ceiling?TERRIBLE - $50 meal - Poor steak - with potato chips, store bought bread and one bowl of beans to share???? Would I go back to Phoenix? Yes, with my husband (maybe with an older more independant child that could play at pool by herself) and A LOT of $$.
