We booked only because every where else in town was full and looked at the last review and thought ok great location and comfortable beds, made all the previous ones seem possibly an exageration. NOT AT ALL people believe me you will hate this place! Upon arrival we were greated by a woman that could not speak english hardly at all, unable to answer our questions about the age of the hotel, parking, etc. Upon check in we got our room keys and were placed on the 9th floor on the way up the elevator which sounded horrible BTW the elevator stopped on the 2nd floor to pick up another rider going up, I about vomited right there the carpet was so terribly stained and the smell emitting from that floor was horrible, We made it to the 9th and although stained carpet not even half as bad as the 2nd floor we were a bit more hopeful. We booked a standard double room, and that's what you get, a tiny double sized bed, old linens, filthy carpet, gross tiny bathroom but we had running water and heat so decided to make the most of it. We all (2 couples 2 rooms) headed out on the town upon arriving back at our hotel, the elevator was out of service we were told the stairs were our only choice, 9 stories later exhausted we finally made it to our rooms and literally fell exhausted into our beds, we awoke the next morning only to learn the elevator was still out of service, meaning we got to haul all our luggage down 9 floors, filthy staircase and something all over the stairs of the 4th to the 2nd floor made it treacherous as well. Today being 4 days later my muscles still ache I've yet to hear back from the manager (we requested some sort of a discount) I'm betting we won't hear back and we chalk it up to learning the hard way. I'd much rather stay in a hostel or sleep in a park then ever step foot in this horrid excuse for a hotel again!!!!

I could barely sleep because the place is so ghetto, you sit in your room worried about your safety and your valuables.

Holes in the sheets, no toilet paper roll, just sitting on the sink, an old water furnace with peeling paint (is it lead based?). The TV has about 5 working chanels and has a hole in the plastic. The wiring is obviously shoddy and I found a working outlet on my third try. The heat runs so hot and does not adjust. You have to open a window. The window has no screen and I was on the 8th floor (Do Not stay here with a child). The wallpaper was badly peeling, exposing mold and mildew on the walls. I can only imagine how poor the air quality was. No WiFi in the room. The neighbors next to me were having relations loudly and the walls are paper thin. After hearing the walls bang for a few minutes, I had to get some fresh air. The surrounding area is full of homeless and shady characters. There is a terrible bar in the basement that attracts scumbags and white trash who hang out in front of the entrance. The thing is, this room cost me $95!!! I've got great hotels in other major cities, Chicago, NY, Orlando for this range that are great. This is a Roach Motel that is best suited for drug use and prostitution. It should offer hourly rates. I took off my watch and ring just to make sure no one was casing me out. The worst part is that the website is completely misleading.

Also the Wifi was in the loby only and it was a nightmare - the man on reception had to keep resetting the router.

It was modest accommodations and worth the $115 price. Our room was on the 8th floor and had no air conditioning; however, the windows were open to allow for the cool night air. Note that the window have no screens! And, because downtown is very noisy at night, we heard the nighlife from the local clubs and delivery trucks well into the wee hours.

I read all the previous reviews and was concerned but decided it would be an adventure and if nothing else we would have a good story.

If you want luxury, and newer accommodations, then by all means stay at the \"mocking\" W hotel. But if you were reamed liked we were on the airfare and don't have the money, stay here.

That's about the only nice thing I can say about this place. The photos of the hotel are very misleading. Standing outside looking at the hotel, you have to wonder if the photo on their website has been doctored at all. The photos of the rooms were obviously taken at a different hotel because the room I was put in, and then moved to another looked NOTHING like the room photos on their website. As someone else said in a previous review about this hotel, don't walk around the room without your shoes and socks on. Definitely not a romantic getaway (unless you're trying to break up with someone.) The sheets had hair on them. I requested a non-smoking room, but you could tell that someone had smoked in it previously. There was no air condtioning or a fan. Big deal, it's Seattle, right? Wrong. It was 90 plus degrees during my stay. The windows do open though, providing little relief. Cable television? Non-existant. I was told that sometimes it comes in, and sometimes it doesn't. What does that mean, really? It's sad when you pay $96 a night and can't even get the local channels (NBC, ABC, CBS.) Go on the internet for your news? There is no internet, unless you want to setup your laptop for dialup. The restaurant downstairs was a dive. Again, the service was great, but as with the rooms, you could tell that management didn't quite care about upgrading anything. Several times during my meal, I could have swore I saw something scurrying across the floor. The waitress seemed embarrassed while attempting to relieve me of my worries. I forgot to mention the lobby. The sofa was very comfortable. In fact, it may have been the nicest thing in the entire hotel. However, don't lean your head back while on the sofa or you'll notice that there is paint peeling off the ceiling in large chunks held together by duct tape in places. Speaking of duct tape, there was actually duct tape holding the carpet together in several places. The room I stayed in had scotch tape holding the wallpaper over this gaping hole. Security risk? Room keys have the room number and hotel name on the key ring. So, don't bring anything valuable, because who knows how often the locks are changed and if previous customers have lost their keys on drinking binges in Pioneer Square. There is no room service. It looked like there was only one person there at all times. If you're hungry, don't eat the food in the vending machine. Both the pretzels and Twix candybar were past their expiration date. At check out, staff was apologetic for the things I told them, but obviously not at fault. While you could sense their understandable frustration through their body language (not quite making eye contact, embarrased look on their face), you got the feeling that they hear about similar guest experiences on a regular basis. It's a shame because it's in a great location. You almost wonder if management is even in it to make money. I never did hear back from them after I sent a letter detailing my disappointments.
