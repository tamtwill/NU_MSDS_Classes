The room at first glance was beautiful but being a newer hotel I was suprised to see as many signs of wear and tear. We were lucky enough to get a room on the 5th floor so had access to a balcony area for smoking which was great because the hotel only has non smoking rooms so I thought we'd have to make a trek to the lobby each time.

I'm a Marriott Platinum which they acknowledged when I checked in and told me they gave me a nice room. Later I found out that 2 of my colleagues who are Silvers in the program were upgraded to suites and sent notes from the manager saying how thrilled they were to have them staying. I received neither an upgrade nor a note so I guess my high degree of loyalty to Marriott doesn't matter at this hotel! The room was nice and beds were comfy but the A/C didn't work. It took them an hour to fix it and then they left plaster and who knows what else all over my carpet so I had to call down again to ask for someone to vacuum. The front desk staff was only mildly helpful but the staff supporting our meeting were very nice. Lobby was beautiful but as others have said there are obvious areas they haven't addressed in the renovation. I said Hail Mary's every time I got in the elevator as it frequently stopped a couple inches above or below the floor and I felt it was only a matter of time before I got stuck. The concierge lounge is very limited although the free breakfast they offered instead was quite nice. The gym is in serious need of an overhaul.

One was because I really thought it was neat to learn that a concept that the hotel follows is \"to find something wonderfully new\".

Thomas the bellman was great at giving us directions and advice on some great local places, and not to mention was always seemed to be there and greeted me and my friends every time I went downstairs.

The atmosphere was lively and the hotel was nice. The rooms were big with huge bathrooms. However I had a few more than few problems that I would not expect when staying at a Marriott. If it wasn't for outstanding customer service I would have rated this stay a 2. The following things led to a poor experience: No hot water one morning. Three days (of seven) my room wasn't cleaned - around 4 or 5 PM I called to inquire and they were very responsivenss to sending housekeeping, but I'm not sure why it wasn't done. Bar service is very slow - the bartenders were nice however you often had to wait a long time for drinks/food. It wasn't really their fault, they were understaffed and it showed during busy times and happy hour. Valet - HUGE problem. Took at least 15-20 minutes to get my car, on one occasion they 'accidently' parked me in behind a bunch of cars parked for an event and I had to wait almost 45 minutes. The concierge lounge was subpar and needs improvement. In saying all of this, my stay was turned around by great customer service. I called management to speak about the problems and Andrea was terrific. She listened to my concerns, apologized, and followed up so things could be improved. The experience had not met my expectations of staying at a Marriott, however Andrea restored my trust in Marriott's commitment to great customer service. Additionally, Amanda at the front desk was so friendly and helpful. The concierage was a bit rude when I inquired about something, but I spoke with Amanda and she was able to provide a much better solution. She was cheerful and always willing to help. Hotel staff often make or break your experience, and Amanda's great attitude and friendliness along with Andrea's handling of problems are the reasons that this stay was turned into a positive one.

Two things that were really disappointing about my stay: - The valet service was pretty horrible. In the morning, I would call 15 minutes before I wanted my car (they recommend 10) and my keys would still be hanging on the board when I went downstairs to fetch my car. I also had brought my car back and told them to keep it out since I was leaving again in 10 minutes. I went downstairs, and it was back in the garage. Luckily the restaurant held my reservation. - The shower was also horrible. Most renaissances have the waterfall shower heads, and this one had one from the 80s. There was usually no water pressure when I showered at 5am, and the water was cold every morning except my last one there. I had to wash my hair in the sink multiple times.

The rooms were affordable and very nice. The staff treated us like queens! But the best part of all was our catering manager, Michael Petersen-Incorvaia, who treated us like family. No request was too big or small. He made us feel at home, provided us with much needed insight and guidance, and never once got annoyed with our crazy changes in food, set up, or needs. Michael Petersen-Incorvaia is the crowning jewel in the catering/convention department!", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFloyd makes it happen!\u201d", "Author": "Jtnjr3129", "ReviewID": "UR124059866", "Content": "It all starts at the front door with Floyd and just keeps getting better and better!", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Yellowstone", "Title": "\u201cGreat Beds!\u201d", "Author": "patit", "ReviewID": "UR123877591", "Content": "Good Service.

We had room on 15th floor and could see the gorgeous sunrises reflected on the cityscape. The room was large and very clean. Only weakness was no safe or refrigerator. Perhaps to be installed later? Immediately outside the hotel was the metro rail system that took us to great restaurants and museums. Rode all day for $3.50-went to the Heard Museum, the Art Museum and took bus to the large Scottsdate shopping mall- all for the one day price. Well within walkingdistance to nice restaurants and pro-team athletic areas too. So simple to follow directions and the concierge made it all easywith maps. All personnel at the hotel were so friendly and asked us repeatedly if they could help us. We will definitely stay there again.

Inside the hotel, which had changed hands from Wyndham to Renaissance only month before I stayed, the rooms are very nice, spacious, and beds are exceptionally comfortable. I spend about 100 nights a year in hotel rooms, so am used to restless nights in hotel rooms, but for the five nights I was here, I slept like a log every night - and that made me hate to leave.
