At the same time, it's just out of the main party areas so there isn't much noise the whole night keeping you awake. - Service. The management was easy to deal with before arrival, and during our stay. They helped plan the best departure time to get to the airport, and recommended some fantastic restaurants (instead of being recommended whoever has left a flyer at the hotel). - Comfort. I'm not too picky with hotel rooms, so I'll just say that it was clean, comfortable, and everything worked that I needed (not sure about TV/Internet, etc). There was also an unlimited supply of bottled water for anyone to use, which is extremely helpful for a summer holiday in Barca. I wish more hotels did this! Cons: None really.

It was very roomy and clean w/ a large modern bathroom and was perfect for the whole family. Although we were in the Annex the room was immaculately maintained by the staff and we were only about 10 meters from the front desk. And for Barcelona it was a great deal at 130 Euros a night. Besides really liking the hotel itself, one of best aspects of it is the location in the heart of El Born neighborhood. Its on a nice quiet pedestrian street lined w/ great restaurants and a very short walk to the historic Santa Maria del Mar church. We ate at Taller de Tapas twice (our trip also included La Rioja, Asturias - where my wife is from and Segovia before flying out Madrid) and it was our favorite tapas place in all of Spain. We also had dinner at Senyor Parellada for classic filling Catalan cuisine, which was an amazing meal and amazingly cheap for the quality, portions and fine dining service. Besides the immediate neighborhood the hotel is basically a ten minute walk or less to the Catedral, La Rambla, La Boqueria Market, the waterfront / Aquarium and the Parque Ciutadella and Barcelona Zoo. Our children really loved all of these attractions (OK, maybe not the cathedral so much...) which made the hotel a great location for families. And besides that it was an easy few stop metro (located a 1/2 block from the hotel) to La Sagrada Familia, again making it very convenient for most of the main tourist attractions. Speaking of the metro though... while on it we were one of the many tourists in Barca who get pick pocketed and basically were targeted b/c of the kids. Although this was a very frustrating afternoon the front desk (and Camilla in particular) were EXCELLENT in helping us deal w/ our credit cards, get a police report and most importantly contacting the Motor Vehicle Dept in the US to receive a faxed abstract of my DL so I could still rent a car and continue on w/ our journey across Spain. They really went above and beyond what would be expected and for that I am still grateful. So although we loved the hotel anyway due to the Annex Suite and great location in El Born, it was the service provided during this stressful moment that both helped salvage our trip and prompted me to share my experience and strongly recommend their establishment.

Upon my notice that we had already agreed upon everything before, Mr. Juan Pablo at the reception explained that he has arrived at 3:00 PM that day and he does not care about my arranagments. In the meantime Mrs. Emelie from the reception was just smiling at our conversation and considered everything to be a good joke. There was no one on the duty responsible that evening, so we could not really speak to anybody else. The manager's name was declined to us. The best part happened when we tried to check out - there was an attempt to charge us double price presuming we had not paid1/2 for the hotel before. Again we needed to enter into discussions and prove our point. So, my advise is to avoid this hotel if you want a stay without arguing to the staff.

Firstly, the location is simply brilliant, right in the heart of El Born and the Old City. The building is beautiful, the staff are wonderful and the food in the attached restaurant was delicious and authentic. I recommend the Oxtail, and the Anchovies with bread. Great olives served up in paper cones and divine wines. The restaurant looks and feels like a Michelin starred restaurant. OK, so here come the cons. Noise. We were staying in one of the suites which are located in a building further down the street. Our room overlooked the street. Firstly, it was very noisy, Argentera is a main pedestrian thoroughfare and our first night (a Saturday) was spent awake until 6am when the church bells rang out. There was loud singing and shouting from revellers, it sounded like a carnival out there! The hotel cannot be held responsible for this but it would be sensible to insulate the windows better. Light. The buildings are old, in those days they built buildings in Spain to be tall and close together to create some shelter from the fierce midday sun...as a result, the buildings are designed to be dark but the management need to provide better lighting, the lighting in the rooms from table lamps to reading lights etc was all wrong and generally not bright enough. We wanted to open the curtains fully to let in as much natural daylight as possible but couldn't because of the office building across the way and people looking in. It really did feel like a dark cave in there. Internet Access. There is wifi internet in the building but the base station emitting the signal is too far away from the suites we stayed in and we therefore couldn't get online. This was actually a fairly major thing for me as I needed to keep in touch with work stuff in case deadlines were missed and not being able to check emails from the room was a pain. Some simple and inexpensive changes would turn a good hotel into a great hotel. How difficult would it be to change the lightbulbs to be a brighter wattage, put a new router near the suites to increase the signal for internet and put in some double glazing? We would definitely go again but we would choose a room in the main hotel, higher up to get the maximum natural daylight.

Most of my comments are re the hotel. First, the bad. This hotel looks chic, but it was all done on the cheap and now it's showing its age. Nothing major, just a lot of little things that, taken together, made it seem shabby. The floors were fake wood and were buckling, giving a weird squishy uneven feeling when you walked around, the magnifying mirror (which you sort of had to use because it was lighted and the bathroom was so dark) had broken and was floppy so you had to hold it up to look in it, the sink plugs had broken off their chains and were just left that way, stuff like that. Also there was dust on the tables and lamps, the floor felt gritty, and the idea to paint the shower black wasn't a good one because the housekeepers are apparently unable to remove the white water grime. The room we had 3 nights faced a side street and didn't have much street noise when the windows were closed, but it was right by the elevator, which was quite loud. Also had a very ill-mannered American woman across the hall the first night who evidently had a spat with her boyfriend and was slamming doors and yelling for an extended period starting around 2:30 in the morning. Not exactly the hotel's fault, but I felt like it was sort of the kind of place that attracts the wrong clientele or something. The room was dark. There was no wifi available, even in the lobby, but there were two computers for guest use. I think there were DSL connections in the rooms, but we hadn't brought a laptop, just iphones. The good. Complimentary bottled water was a perk. The air conditioning worked well. Location was excellent, just a half block from the metro and right in the heart of great shopping and restaurants. I liked the neighborhood best of any we visited in Barcelona - a nice feel with little narrow streets, not much traffic, a very young crowd. Graffiti focused on political themes, which to my mind is best if there has to be graffiti. There was a little restaurant close by called Bubo that we ate at several times and liked a lot. Best coffee we found anywhere in Spain, for one thing, and the desserts were fantastic. The suite: not technically a suite, but much larger, quieter, and it was nice not to have to exchange fake smiles with the hotel desk staff, who were not exactly friendly. The suites are a few blocks away from the hotel, and we never saw another soul in the building while we were there. I might have felt a little uncomfortable if I had been alone, especially with the sign telling you not to sleep or leave the room with the window open. But as it was, it was sort of nice.

We reported this problem to the front desk at the first afternoon we arrived. They confirmed to check. The other morning we informed them again, they said it was already fixed.

The three of us agree with the positive reviews about this hotel. We were very happy here: the rooms are very nice indeed, location cannot be better, hotel amenities excellent, including the free water and apples at each floor, excellent european breakfast buffet, cleanliness, reception staff very helpfull and friendly. The location in the Barri Gotic is excellent: the major sights are all within easy walking distance: Barceloneta, Modernista buildings on the Passeig de Gracia, the Rambla, Palau de la Musica. For the Sagrada Familia church you need to get a subway train or bus. The subway station is right next door. Very handy. The Born district of Barcelona has many tapas bars and restaurants and many (upmarket) boutiques. Overall a nice and safe place to stay. However, if you are planning to wake up later than 7.30 in the morning this is probably not the place for you. Every morning around this time construction work starts in neighboring buildings. Likewise: if you sleep light, be advised: from 11 till 2 at night empty wine bottles are thrown by the bucket load into dumpsters. It is fair to say this goes with the territory, as this is a district with bars and restaurants open till late at night. It did not bother us that much: we stayed from sunday night till thursday, only sunday night was very noisy. We always get up early, so we were not bothered with all the construction work going on. As to the tapas bars in the same street as the hotel: we liked the Tapas bar La taberna del Cobre a lot: good food, nice, efficient service and a very reasonable price. We were very unhappy with the Taller de Tapas bar (also on the same street as the hotel) : when we were getting ready to order our food and drinks, we wanted to order three glasses of wine. The waiter tried to talk us into buying a bottle which was not what we wanted, and a lot more expensive than the price in neighboring bars and tapas restaurants. He was very obnoxious and insisted that a bottle would be our best buy. His cheapest offer was 4,80 euro per glass. As we prepared to leave, he suddenly discovered the housewine that was 2,80 per glass. By now however, we were angry and so put off by this obvious attempt at ripping us off, that we got up and left - and went next door, to the Cobre tapas bar for the second time, where we were given a free drink after our dinner! We don't know what the quality of the food at the Taller is, but we DO KNOW that we don't like to be treated like this. This restaurant was always very busy, so probably the food is okay, but its probably wise to be alert and don't be railroaded into ordering things you really don't need or want.

I chose a suite as I wanted additional space for luggage etc and to be able to sit and relax whilst sorting out my forthcoming travel plans etc. The suites turned out to be located in an apartment building down a narrow alley distanced some way from the main hotel. There were some homeless people and stray dogs around and I did not feel very safe walking at night back to the room. The suite itself was over-looked by opposite apartments which meant one had to keep the curtains drawn all of the time. The sitting area (an uncomforatble settee/bed) of the bedroom was divorced from viewing the TV and had very poor lighting. If you understand Spainish then you will OK to watch TV. The hotel receptionist said that the TV's in the suites could not have the language changed on the TV set. In fact the reception on the TV was pretty poor anyway - I guess it was due to the alley way location. To view the TV required one to sit on the bed as there were no armchairs - only one upright chair at the desk location. Free internet access in the room was an appealing asset of the hotel advertised facilities Yet at the desk area there was no telephone point so it was necessary to sit on the bed where the telephone point was located under the bedside table. So it was not comfortable to work at ones' laptop siting on the bed. Three of the lights were not working in the room and had to be replaced. So in other words housekeeping had not really checked out the room. Whilst there was free water in the refrigerator, two of the botles had been opened and partially used! Another housekeeping failure. As the room was away from the hotel it would have been nice if coffee making facilites had been included in this room price. We used the dining rooom in the evening and whilst it seemingly has a good reputation, the meal was not exceptional as we had hoped. The femail receptionists on the arrival afternoon were very friendly and helpful as they could be which could not be said of their male counterparts the following morning. No smiles greeted you and they behaved as they were doing you a favour. I politley reminded the hotel of some of the inadequacies of the room and things that still needed to be addressed before there were new room occupants. I also suggested that it would be helpful to have an actual clock in the room. The receptionist pointed to my wristwatch and asked why I could not use that instead.

Located centrally in the centre everything is on hand. The area El Born district is really nice with lots of lovely tapas bars within a stones throw away. Very close to the marina and beach too. Nearby is a cafe / bistro called Milkat 21 Gignas (www.milkbarcelona.com) which is great for brunch If you come out of the hotel and turn left I'd recommend the tapas bars there (eaten in them several times) and a bit further up take a right and there is a bar called La Luna which is a good place to visit. I would make one note of warning, this is a touristy area and late at night the atmosphere changes (after the tapas bars shut)-don't go walking around on your own as there are a lot of unfriendly characters about. Also beware of carrying too many valuables with you. We enjoyed sitting out in the tapas bars on the friday night around midnight but the next evening we were still out post wedding at 1 / 2 am ish and it was quite a different story The hotel The staff were all really friendly and helpful during our stay and couldn't have done more for us. The rooms were nice but very modern. This was fine for us but if you don't like chic modern this isn't the place for you. The suits are of a generous size and located in a building a couple of doors down (something to be aware of if you have children). Our room was very spacious but some of the other family members rooms were not as big. The beds are the same size in all the rooms (very large about 6ft) which is great but the size of the bathroom varies and not all have baths. However this wasn't a problem for us as we didn't want to spend much time in the room. If your room doesn't have a fridge then there are some located in the hallways with free still and sparkling water which is really handy and a nice touch. I've been to Barcelona several times and would highly recommend it as a city to visit. Its easy to get around, there is lots to do and see and its a vibrant place.

It's very true that the hotel is centrally located and that is by far the best thing one can say about it. The room we had was small with only a small kitchen type chair to sit on if you used the other one chair to open your luggage on. This is totally forgivable in my mind but my wife has a back issue and found the room very uncomfortable.

The Hotel Banys Oriental fulfilled all our needs, ticking all the boxes and more!! We were allocated one of the suites in the annexed building. We had reservations about being based away from the main hotel at first but these were unfounded. We were delighted with our chic, well-designed spacious suite with a balcony overlooking the pedestrianised street below us, and a mezzanine with comfy sofa. The decor was modern yet understated and elements of the original Gothic architecture had been retained which made this a unique hotel experience. I think what made our stay in the Hotel Banys so good was the fact that we were made to feel like we were being looked-after which was in stark contrast to our stay at the Hostal Fontanella just a short distance away (see my review under the title Control Freaks!). ALL the staff were SUPER helpful and friendly and were more than willing to make our stay the best it could possibly be. We thought the cost of the suite at 135euros was great value for the standard of decor and service we received.

We booked direct by e-mail, and they were very efficient and answered questions promptly in English. We felt that the room price was excellent value. We caught the bus to Barcelona from Girona Airport with no trouble, and because it was very hot when we arrived at the bus station we decided against carrying luggage up and down stairs on the metro and caught a taxi instead - 15 minutes in heavy traffic, \u20ac8, not bad, and a friendly lady driver who dropped us off at the corner. We travelled around the city by metro on one day, using a ten journey ticket between the two of us, and found it easy, and the rest of the time we walked slowly because of the heat, and with a prolonged lunch somewhere, and a siesta back at the cool hotel that worked fine. Our second floor room was very stylish, especially the bathroom, but it was quite tight to get around the bed, and there was a huge wardrobe but no drawer space or hooks to keep things tidy. However, who cares, for three days? The wardrobe safe, air conditioning and free iced water and internet were all very much appreciated, and the bed was wonderful. We looked out at the back of the hotel on to a quiet area. The staff in reception were unfailingly helpful and courteous, those in the restaurant were less smiley, but did the necessary. We were using both English and Spanish and felt that their knowledge of both might have been less confident than the reception staff. We ate one dinner and all our breakfasts in the hotel, and they were all delicious and very good value, especially the breakfasts if you can eat lots from a buffet in the morning, easy to fill up and then you don't need much later. If you don't want to eat much for breakfast, it's probably cheaper to go elsewhere, like right next door to the hotel. We also had some lovely lunches and dinners in the bars and restaurants round the city, and can recommend the Taller de Tapas and the Taberna del Cobre in the same street as the hotel. We didn't know Barcelona, and three days was a good introduction, one for the historic central part, one for the port and beach area, and one for the Gaud\u00ed trail.

The welcome pack in the bathroom of the hotel is a nice touch, as are the complimentary bottles of water on each floor which you can help yourself to each day. It is a little noisy and the bathroom is like a sauna however these 2 negatives are totally outweighed by the location, clean and comfortable rooms which are well decorated and furnished, complimentary water, welcome pack, free internet access and directly above a superb restaurant (Senyor Parellada). The Santa Maria church and square are a stone's throw from the hotel. The square has a good wine bar called La Vinya del Senyor where you can sit outside in the square and watch the world go by with a glass or bottle of whatever your heart desires from a huge wine list. There are small restaurants and a bar (Buba) next door which are all worth a visit. If you walk round from the square in the direction of the zoo you'll find a boulevard which comes alive after 11pm with local bars - well worth a visit if you like to keep away from the tourist bars. Avoid the acclaimed restaurant called Los Caracoles - we had a terrible meal there which was very expensive. The paella was inedible and the bread rolls were stale. It was such a disappointment after having queued for a table. On a different night we also queued for La Fonda which is just a long the street from Los Caracoles. The meal was excellent and really good value for money - well worth queuing for. Sightseeing Tips: Casa Batllo is well worth a visit if you like to do something different indoors. Avoid the Vasquez part of the Picasso Museum as it is mind numbinging rubbish. Make a visit to Park Guell as a stop on the Bus Touristic route. Don't pay to enter the Sagrada Familia. The inside of the beautiful cathedral is literally a building site with nothing to see other than a queue of people waiting 90 minutes to get the lift to the top of one of the spires.

The hotel was EXTREMELY noisy, both from within the hotel and from the outside street. Sources of noise from within the hotel: the wooden floors, the lift (strangely loud) and the hotel's decision to start working on the plumbing at 8am. Sources of noise from outside the hotel: street cleaning trucks, revelers and drunks, and the single windows unfortunately did not guard us whatsoever. Honestly, i cannot understand anyone NOT being disturbed by the noise. Over breakfast we chatted with other guests who experienced the exact same thing even though their room was on the other side of the hotel. Oh, speaking of breakfast, SKIP IT. The selection looked old and unfresh. There are many options just outside the hotel and much more delicious. In conclusion, I would stay here again, but this time I'm going to bring ear plugs.

For this price range, I thought the hotel was wonderful. The location is great - within walking distance of the Cathedral, the Santa Maria del Mar, the harbor, the Ramblas, and great shopping. Metro and bus are also close by. I would note that the street noise can be a bit loud at night (particularly since locals keep later hours than the average Brit, American or German). This did not bother me at all, but I can see that if you were a light sleeper, you might find the level of activity at 1 a.m. to be bothersome. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The restaurant next door had good food and I would recommend making a reservation for dinner there. The breakfast was expensive (10 Euro per day), but the variety of items was excellent. We only had breakfast in the hotel twice and of course, it was a European breakfast ( a lot of different rolls, breads, croissants), cheeses, meats, cereals, soft boiled eggs, and fruit. There were a lot of options and the quality was good. If you just want coffee and a croissant or a panini, I would recommend skipping the hotel breakfast and heading out to a local cafe (considerably less expensive). The hotel also has computers that you can use on the second floor to check your e-mail or surf the Web. This is free of charge and I found it to be a nice service in terms of checking in with home. The rooms themselves are very nice ...contemporary design and very clean. The hotel provides slippers, shampoo, bath gel, lotion, a hairbrush, comb, sponge, toothbrush, showercap, etc. to guests. This was a nice perk. For this class of hotel, I really only expected soap and perhaps shampoo, so I was pleasantly surprised at all the other toiletries. The bathroom was also nice, if small. The only thing that I really didn't like about the room was that the bathroom had no ventilation...fan or otherwise. As a result, there was always a lingering mildew smell in the bathroom. Finally, the hotel provided a refrigerator full of bottled water, available to guests on the floor.

We had booked one of the suites and on arrival the receptionist carried my wife's case to our room which was less than a minute away from the main hotel. The suites are entered through two iron security gates and up a a staircase. We were quite happy that these gates were in place as the road that the Hotel is located on is very busy with pedestrians and having left quite a lot of electrical equipment in the room the extra security gives additional peace of mind. We stayed in suite A1 and it was very similar to the photos shown on the website. We did find that the suite was quite dark although we did think that this was in keeping with the style of the room and there were numerous lamps and spotlights to brighten things up. As mentioned in previous reviews there is a fridge in the room stocked with still and sparkling water and any used bottles are replaced free of charge each day. On the mezzanine level there was a large couch and a lamp which was perfect for relaxing and applying sun tan lotion ! The bathroom was quite small containing a shower and toilet with the sink being located outside.We certainly did not have any problems with a lack of hot water as had been reported by a previous reviewer.

The menu is quite simple but everything we tried was absolutely delicious - so much so that we ate there 5 times ! It is also unbelivable value for money - 3 course meal for two with a bottle of wine and coffees was about 40 Euros ! The restaurant is really popular with queues starting about 30 minutes before opening time - we estimated that there must have been about 100 people in front of us one night, but having been seated, the service was fantastic. Another favorite and highly recomended place is La Vinya del Senyor located in Placa de Santa Maria which as would be expected only serves wines. The staff were extremely knowledgable and helpful and as a lover of dessert wines we discovered the ultimate in Castano Dulce which was absolutely amazing.

Pros: Forget the Ramblas, the hotel is in the best part of Barcelona, El Born. More restaurants, wine bars and medieval ambience than one could shake a leg of ham at. The adjoining restaurant was one of our favorites (we eat there twice). The free water was nice and often needed. Cool suites with modern look and the price was right. Cons: The sleek modern look was better viewed from the Internet than in person. For example, instead of removing the old decor, i.e., sinks, cabinets, etc. the hotel simply installed false walls to cover it up; a bit strange. This leads to the biggest con, because of limited space do to the false walls, they only installed a 10-gallon hot water heater. It lasted exactly 9 minutes; we timed it, and took 4 hours to reheat. We either showered together (very small shower) or, one at night and one in the mourning. The suite had a large two-story window that looked out at the staircase, not much of a view. Noise wasn\u2019t much of an issue but in the busy season I could see how it would be. The staff is young and not very helpful or knowledgeable. Things to be aware of: There are two different suite buildings, one building is right next to the main hotel and the other is 300 yards away, down a small dark alley. After complaining about the limited hot water, the hotel offered to move us to one of the suites down the street, which has newer hot water systems. We got an uneasy feeling about the location and declined. So uneasy, in fact, we would rather take 4-minute shows than stay there. As for the standard rooms located in the main building, they seemed fine but small. However, be aware many rooms and even entire floors were unfinished. Guests had to climb over paint cans and other debris to get to there rooms.

The best coffee is at a franchise near the hotel called Cappachino. Anyway, we asked for two adjoining rooms and unfortunately, they did not have two next door to each other the day we arrived.

Pros: - Nice design, although the monochrome colours seemed a bit dull after the bright reds of the Camper. - Free water good since Barcelona's tastes awful. - Although the hotel does not have wi-fi, I was given an ethernet cable to connect to the port in the room. This worked perfectly. - Nice bathroom, although some of the tiles in the shower need to be replaced. Strange double taps? Cons - Soundproofing. The problem bothered us at first, but we got used to it. One can hear people talking on the street even with all the windows closed. Occasionaly we could hear conversations and tv in the room next door. The problem is manageable and not quite as bad as some other reviews have made it out to be. All in all, at about E100 for a double, Banys Orientals is a sobre choice if one of your prerequisites is nice design. I have done a lot of research on boutique hotels in Barcelona in this pricerange, and this still seems to be the best choice.", "Date": "January 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201c3rd Visit in 18 months\u201d", "Author": "gargas", "ReviewID": "UR4242146", "Content": "Yes, the bathrooms smell - though I think it's less due to lack of cleanliness and more due to a lack of ventilation - and yes there's a bit of noise from the uncarpeted hallways and streets outside, but the location is unparalleled, and the price is unbeatable.

The suites are not in the same building as the hotel, which we knew. However, when we entered the building where the suites were located, it was literally like entering a prison. We passed through a metal gate door which you have to slam shut for it to lock. Then we walked up two flights of stairs into a cement courtyard (we called it the dungeon) to get to our room. There was a loud refrigerator there holding the bottled water. There were no plants, very little lighting (which seemed dangerous since the door was hardly ever closed and locked), no chairs or table -- just a dark, windy, and a liitle scary area to pass through before entering your room. Fortunately we were on the first level. Other guests had to climb an enormous metal staircase with their luggage to get to their rooms -- there is no elevator. There are also no employees in the suite building. The room did look like the pictures we have seen online, but some things have to be noted in person. The floors which appear to be hardwood, are in fact, vinyl - made to look like wood. This would have been okay (albeit a little cheesy) except that they were filthy and bumpy. The lighting in the room, the bathroom, and the loft space was so poor that it was quite depressing. There is no overhead lighting - only one floor lamp (which we moved down from the loft because we literally couldn't see) and 2 table lamps, all with low wattage bulbs. The bed frame was a made out of a cheap wood painted black -- ikea-esque, but worse, with screws sticking out on the bottom. There were 2 strange clip lights on the bed frame that were like car headlights. As it was November, and getting cold, we could understand the room being a bit cold, but our room was unbearably cold. We turned the temperature up as high as it could go, and it was still too chilly to stay in there any longer than we had to. The loft space was boiling hot, and the downstairs was icy. Not to mention that the room was so dark and dreary that we wanted to be anywhere else. We tried to change hotels, but were unable to find anything. We called to tell them about the lighting situation and the freezing temp, and they said that it would be warmer and brighter in the morning with the light streaming through the windows. That never happened, even on a bright sunny day. It was dark, cold and depressing for the duration of our stay. When we say dark, I mean, we could not see our clothes in the suitcase! We asked to change rooms, but nothing was available. The bathroom was more of the same -- dark and cold -- very unpleasant. The boiler broke in our room the day before we left and we had no hot water. They said that it could not be fixed until the following day when we were checking out anyway. We were also unsure of the cleanliness of everything. For the six days that we were there, the sink area was never cleaned -- made us wonder what else was never cleaned. We know that they did not change the sheets on the bed either. The breakfast, although plentiful was a bit disappointing. It seemed as though not everything was so fresh -- some stale bread, cheese that sat out for too long. But overall we were able to eat well enough to start our day. We did not have any English channels on our tv which would have been nice to have during siesta time. There were a few upsides -- the price, location, and the free bottled water. We would not recommend this hotel for more than 2 nights. We also suggest staying in the main hotel instead of the suites. Our overall opinion was that on the surface everything looks good, but underneath there was not much quality.", "Date": "December 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cWill stay again\u201d", "Author": "tocanada2", "ReviewID": "UR4144585", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for three week day nights in early November.

I know that others have complained about the thin walls and noise from outside but I heard nothing. Excellent cold breakfast buffet for E9.60 - cereals, fresh fruit, cold cuts, cheese, juice, coffee etc. The staff were very friendly and helpful and all spoke English. There was a safe in the room (enter a 4 digit combination). Room was all black and white decorations and was very clean. Very nice having free cold bottled water available.
