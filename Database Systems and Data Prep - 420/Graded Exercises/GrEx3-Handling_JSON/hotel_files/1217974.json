{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Most stylish hotel in university district I travel to Seattle several times a year and am always looking for new places to explore. No more. I've found a home with hotel Deca. Their rooms are so stylishly decorated that the Intimon Theater replicated them on stage for a play. The staff is knowledgeable about the area and goes out of their way to be helpful. This is the U Washington area with numerous eclectic restaurants and cafes, and intriguing shops. I'm a hiker. I discovered several gorgeous trails within a mile from the hotel. If you're visiting a friend at the University, or if you're too familiar with the tourist areas and hotels of Seattle., try the Deca! It's comfortable, stylish, and located in a great area for exploring !", "Date": "Dec 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR718449910", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Texani"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d1217974-r22522839-Deca_Hotel-Seattle_Washington.html", "HotelID": "1217974", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
