{"Reviews": [{"Content": "SCAM SCAM SCAM - BEWARE!!! The hotel is absolutely terrible - It pays airport and bus station taxis to con you into staying there even if you have accomodations elsewhere .The lobby looks perfectly fine - but once you pay for the room you find out the place is in absolute shambles - nothing works in the rooms - they are old dilapidated and very gross - DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!! There is an excellent hotel less than a block away - Hotel Regente - It is absolutely first class and actually costs less if you book on the internet - $ 57 USD", "Date": "Sep 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR730977722", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "SUPERICO"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d677703-r20087386-Plaza_Madrid-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "677703", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
