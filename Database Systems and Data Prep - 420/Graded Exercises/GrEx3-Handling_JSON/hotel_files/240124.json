The furniture is pretty old and the TV has a sticker on it talking about having a tracking device if you try to steal it. The beds were comfortable enough and the couch folded out to be a 3rd bed. About half the power outlets in the room did not work. The second bathroom had the usual toiletries except for they were already half gone. The room cleaning was poor. The air conditioning unit was horribly noisy in the second bedroom making it hard to sleep. There is almost a full kitchen which is nice that you do not have to eat out. There is no microwave so you cannot reheat most food that you do bring home. There was a sign for ice machines on the 1 & 3rd floor and neither of them worked. When we called the front desk expecting them to bring ice they stated the one on the 2nd floor should be working. I went to check out at the front desk just to make sure all the charges were correct and there was only one person working the front desk around noon so after waiting in like for 15 minutes I simply walked out.

The beds were clean, the stuff was friendly, albeit many workers had limited English. People at the front desk answer the phone immediately and speak perfect English. At one point I phoned the front desk and requested additional coffee packs (oh, yeah, the suite also has a coffee machine). They were brought to me within 10 minutes, at no charge. The pool was somewhat far from our apartment, about 5 minutes walk, but the good thing is that it is open until 11PM at night.

I must say the setup of the room was nice, it had a small living room area w/snack cabinet, dining area, large bed, nice size bathroom and kitchen, also televisions, but once I got settled, I started to notice the lack of cleanliness. I use to work in a hotel, and held multiple positions, one being a housekeeper. If the room I stayed in was inspected, it would fail. I checked the mattress for bed bugs (none); I checked the bedding, which had multiple hairs on the pillows, a significant amount of dust underneath them and on the head of the mattress. It seemed like someone previously slept on the bed, and housekeepers decided not to change the bedding, in other words, remaking it since it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too dirty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (a lot of housekeepers do that to save time). I slept at the foot of the bed and on top the sheets (I was that disgusted). The soap in the dish tray, used to wash hands, was unwrapped and dirty, the towels had hairs, the sink had scum and hairs (I brushed my teeth and cleansed my face in the shower). Later on I ordered room service and a kitchen staff brought it to my door, without announcing herself. I tried telling her I wanted to pay using a different card or cash, but she quickly rejected that idea, because she \"would have had to come back\"....basically she did not want to do it (I still gave her a small tip). The breakfast was good, and I felt somewhat relieved that I was checking out that morning. In a nutshell, it was okay, but they need a better staff (cust/ser. skills), they need to fix damages in the hotel, and they need to inspect rooms. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying for a few hours (like myself) or just a day, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind any of it, then be my guest, but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning to stay in the area longer, then I suggest trying somewhere else. To some, this is would not be a \"deal breaker\", but I'm a very clean person. Not every hotel can be perfect, but come on, you can do better than that. On a scale to 10, I would give the amenities a 7, the staff and the condition of the building/room need to catch up, and then other hotels will be in for some competition.

One of the things I enjoyed most about it was the intimate feel. Even though there were a few kids on the premises -- the hotel, I noticed, is already offering summer camp activities -- the atmosphere remained quiet and relaxing throughout our entire stay. Sometimes it felt as if we had the entire property to ourselves. We enjoyed sunbathing poolside; however, when it came time to go for a dip in the pool, we nearly froze our buns off! Granted, it was fairly breezy outside, but I'm sure the hotel can do a better job of regulating the temperature of the water. I enjoyed the fact that the pool area was nearly empty -- only 2-3 people were there with us on both days. The room was, for the most part, clean and comfortable. I noticed a curtain stain upon arrival, but no biggie. Also, it would have been nice to have a view of the pool from the balcony, but instead we had to settle for that of the parking lot. The bathroom was huge, which is always a plus. We also raved about the bar/restaurant, which was modern in appearance and had a cozy, relaxed feel to it. We paid the bed and breakfast rate and wound up feeling glad we did -- it includes everything from delicious bacon and sausage to bagels to scrambled eggs and cereals. The restaurant also serves delicious -- and moderately priced -- food for dinner. The menu is somewhat limited but that's to be expected when you're at a small hotel. We ate there the first night and just had to go back the next day. I recommend the Churrasco steak and American burger! And I can't say enough about the service; the staff was very polite all throughout. The hotel is near a host of shops and restaurants. I'd definitely recommend Kendall Hotel and Suites -- obviously not for a romantic/honeymoon getaway, but it is definitely worth a shot if you're interested in a short and relaxing stay in Miami.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Petersburg, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot so nice.....\u201d", "Author": "pilot2643", "ReviewID": "UR100209472", "Content": "Once upon a time, you can tell this was a nice hotel.

This is a metaphor for the whole place, in that there are little minor but noticeable frays here and there around the edges of the physical plant, but no big deal, just minor foibles. Overall, and especially for the money, it's a nice, neat, clean, excellent-value place to stay. It's also a little different that the usual cookie-cutter hotel. This hotel consists of a number of free-standing buildings with open atriums, so it has kind of a \"campus\" feel. Don't expect a view, but the grounds are nice, with jogging paths and nicely landscaped green spaces nearby, because this facility is actually located in and at the edge of the Baptist Hospital complex. This location is convenient to 826, the Turnpike, and U.S. 1, and a good place from which to \"pop\" into Miami (depending on the time of day as to whether Miami traffic will allow \"popping\"), amble over to nearby Dadeland or South Miami, or access the deeper Southwest suburbs and sites, such as the Zoo, the Rail Museum, the Redlands, Everglades, & etc. The staff was courteous and helpful, the maid service was diligent and effective, and the pool, bar, and lobby were very nice. This is definitely NOT a beach hotel. It's not a glitzy hotel. It's not the place to indulge your lover or new bride in a romantic getaway, but if you need a clean, decent place to bivouac while visiting the Kendall area, this is a darn good place. I'll stay there again. One ODD note: This facility offers ONLY WIRED internet access IN THE ROOM(s). They have wireLESS internet access ONLY in the lobby / bar. SO, if you\"re bringing a laptop, bring an (RJ-45) ethernet cable. If you want to use it in bed or on the couch, bring a LONG cable, and if you want to use your ipad or wireless-only device, bring your own wireless access point (or plan on spending a lot of time in the lobby / bar).", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cWow!

The only downside of the room was that the housekeepers were a tad \"pushy\" -- they knocked on our door to clean our room twice within an hour (before 9 a.m.) on one day, and the number of hand towels was sporadic from day to day. This in no way means we did not have enough towels, just that one day there were 4 hand towels, another day there was only one, most days there were 2. We chose the \"bed and breakfast\" rate which incuded a breakfast buffet of spicy homefry potatos, scrambled eggs, pancakes, bacon, sausage links, fresh fruit, assorted pastries and breads to toast, made-to-order omelettes, coffee, juice, tea. The food was warm and tasty. The dining room staff was very friendly, as was the front desk staff. I definitely will re-visit this hotel on another trip to the area to visit our daughter.
