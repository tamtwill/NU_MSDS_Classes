    "In this exercise you will work with some TripAdvisor customer review data about a particular hotel. The data is in json files.  To help the hotel understand the feedback the reviews provide, and what it might suggest they should focus on to improve customer experience, in Part I you'll extract each reviewer's ratings of a hotel and will summarize them. You'll save the ratings and the written reviews in separate files that others can use. You'll use Python data structures like dicts, json objects, and pandas DataFrames and Series.  In Part II you'll extract hotel information from a set of json files, saving it into a DataFrame."

Regardless of how you go about it, It's useful as uaual to break down necessary steps into the simplest pieces possible so that you can test each piece to see that it works.

    "Some have found the json_normalize() method in pandas.io.json to be useful for this exercise. It can provide you with some of what you need, but not a \"complete solution.\"  You may also find examples of \"flattening\" json objects with an online search.\n",

    "Now, suppose that your \"Powers That Be\" wanted for their analyses a data set of the hotel information that's in files like these and in 100506.json for a number of hotels. Write Python code to parse the \"HotelInfo\" in all the json files into a single DataFrame for use in subsequent analyses. Take the approach of looping over a number of json files in a single directory, reading in and processing the files one file at a time.  _Do not_ process each of the files separately with code specific to each of them. (Be DRY.) Do it in a loop of some kind, and use the same code for all the files you input.  Your method should work for an arbitrarily large number of json files in a single directory, for anywhere from one hotel file to a \"gninormous\" number of files, and _not_ just for these exact files.\n",
