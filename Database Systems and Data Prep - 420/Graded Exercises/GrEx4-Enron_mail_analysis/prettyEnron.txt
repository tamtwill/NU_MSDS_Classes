The\ntimeline for the work group's activities included\na milestone of ERCOT staff delivering a summary of\nthe Protocol/System gaps on November 15th.  This\nmessage is the delivery of that summary.\n\nThe Consortium conducted a reconciliation of the\nNovember 1 Protocols to the system design.  ERCOT\nstaff reviewed the reconciliation provided by the\nConsortium.  There were a number of issues\nincluded in the reconciliation that are still\nunder review with the vendors.  The finalization\nof that review is being completed as quickly as\npossible.  Based on the decisions during the\nreview, there may be some more issues that will\nneed to be added to the Protocol Implementation\nPlan (PIP).\n\nThere were a number of issues that relate to\nthings that are in the November 1 Protocols that\nare not in the current system design and will not\nbe available on June 1, 2001.  ERCOT staff worked\nvery hard over the last few days to prepare those\nissues to be sent to the PIWG for review and\ncriticality analysis.  ERCOT staff used the\nNovember 1 Protocols as a baseline.  We boxed the\nlanguage that related to things that would not be\navailable and in effect on June 1, 2001.  The box\nincludes a PIP Issue number, explanation of the\nreason the Nov. 1 language is in the box, and an\nexplanation of the restoration process for the\nNovember 1 language.  In the body of the Protocol\ndocument, we drafted redline language which\nreflects what will be in place on June 1, 2001.\n\nThe attached files contain:\n\n(1)   PIP Master List - This is a master list of\nall the Protocol Implementation Plan (PIP) issues\nthat have been identified to date.  It contains an\nissue name, Protocol subsection reference, summary\nof the issue, status, and ERCOT author.\n\n(2)  A file for each PIP issue which contains an\nexcerpt from the Nov. 1 Protocol reflecting the\nboxes and redlined language.\n\n(3)  Reconciliation documents for PIP issues that\nthe PIWG has already discussed.\n\nAll of these issues will be discussed at PIWG\nmeetings.  We will be working with Brad Jones,\nPIWG Chair, to set up the meeting days and the\nagenda for reviewing each of these issues.  The\nagenda will be published prior to the meetings so\nthat organizations have the opportunity to\nidentify the appropriate persons to attend.  In\naddition, ERCOT staff will be working with the\nPIWG during the discussions of each issue.\n\nThe PIWG has a lot to accomplish in a short amount\nof time.  ERCOT staff has prepared the issues to\nhelp expedite the process and contribute to the\nprocess.  We look forward to completing the PIP.\n\nCheryl F.

At a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) hearing today\nin San Diego, Governor Gray Davis reiterated his call to federal regulators\nto intervene \"to the fullest extent possible\" to lower electricity prices in\nCalifornia.\n\n\"FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market\nexists before California consumers and California's economy are subjected to\nunconstrained, market-based electricity prices,\" said Governor Davis in a\nstatement read by Energy Oversight Board Chairman Michael Kahn.\n\"Consequently, I renew my prior request that the Commission act with utmost\nspeed to intervene to the fullest extent possible to restore wholesale\nprices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have resulted from the\nexercise of market power.\"\n\nGovernor Davis noted that he and state lawmakers have taken dramatic action\nin recent weeks to provide rate relief. \"While these actions should provide\nshort-term rate predictability and longer-term benefits to customers in\nterms of improved supplies, the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale\nprices still exists and remains the responsibility of FERC to address,\" said\nthe governor. \"No combination of state actions can substitute for federal\naction to ameliorate the problems of California's wholesale markets.\"\n\nGovernor Davis has taken the following actions in reaction to rising\nelectricity prices in San Diego:\n\nOn June 14, he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all\nstate facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity\nemergency and rolling blackouts.\n\nOn June 15, he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission\n(PUC) to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the San\nFrancisco Bay area the previous day, including a statewide perspective on\nthe price and delivery of electricity. Report was completed, submitted to\nthe governor and released on August 2.\n\nOn July 27, 2000, Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to\ntake swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in\nCalifornia and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in\nrefunds.\n\nIn letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two\nCalifornia-based panels charged with overseeing California's power market,\nhe called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take\nstrong measures to reduce power rates in both the short- and long-term.\n\nOn August 2, 2000, Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to\nreduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it takes\nnew power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies.\n\nOn August 9, 2000, Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission\n(PUC) to establish a two-year plan that would cut electricity rates by\nnearly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas &\nElectric.\n\nThe governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers\nAssociation that will save enough electricity to provide power to between\n50,000 and 60,000 homes during periods of peak demand, as grocers agreed to\nreduce power consumption by 10 percent during Stage One emergencies.\n\nOn August 10, 2000, Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton\nurging him to expedite FERC's investigation to determine whether current\nelectric rates in San Diego were unjust.\n\nOn August 22, 2000, Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release\nemergency funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)\nto the state to help low-income Californians pay their rapidly-rising\nelectricity bills.\n\nOn August 23, 2000, President Clinton responded to Governor Davis' request\nby releasing $2.6 million in emergency funds to help low-income Southern\nCalifornians cope with the surge in their electricity bills. The President\nalso asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the\noperation of U.S. power markets and urged the Small Business Administration\nto use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases.\n\nOn August 23, 2000, Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on\nlegislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers. The governor signed\ntwo bills into law on September 6, 2000.\n\nPlease see attached letter (below).\n\n# # #\n\nSEPTEMBER 12, 2000\n\nSTATEMENT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS\n\nTO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION CONCERNING ITS INVESTIGATION OF\nWHOLESALE PRICE ESCALATION IN CALIFORNIA\n\nThe Summer of 2000 has confronted California with an electricity crisis that\nseriously threatens the safety, health and well being of citizens and\nbusinesses throughout the state. At the heart of the crisis is the\nextraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillary\nservices, accompanied by deteriorating service and reliability. In San\nDiego, electric customers' bills have more than doubled this summer,\nthreatening permanent harm to businesses and the health and welfare of\nresidential customers in the warm southern climate. All remaining California\nelectric consumers are faced with similar prospects as their legislated rate\nfreeze periods come to an end. In San Francisco we saw rolling blackouts for\nthe first time in our history.\n\nAs soon as the dimensions of the crisis became evident, I directed\nCalifornia regulators, including the Public Utilities Commission and the\nElectricity Oversight Board, and the Independent System Operator, to take\nimmediate steps to identify and implement specific measures to mitigate the\ndamage, including restoring price caps at Summer 1999 levels. I am happy to\nreport that those measures have been adopted, although not without\nconsiderable resistance from self-interested parties.\n\nIn recent weeks, I have worked with the California Legislature to enact\nfurther relief within the existing framework of options now available to the\nstate. These include provisions to stabilize retail rates, expedite\ngeneration licensing where possible, implement targeted demand reduction and\ndemand response and remove constraints in transmission and distribution\nsystems. I have also established a task force comprised of key state\nofficials which is developing measures to increase energy efficiency and\nalternative supplies and to expedite permitting by state agencies.\n\nWhile these actions should provide short-term rate predictability and\nlonger-term benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies, the\nfundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains\nthe responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to address.\nNo combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to\nameliorate the problems in California's wholesale markets.\n\nA joint report submitted to me on August 2nd by the Chairman of the\nCalifornia Electricity Oversight Board and the President of the California\nPublic Utilities Commission concluded that exorbitant wholesale prices in\nCalifornia result from wholesale market dysfunction and the exercise of\nmarket power by sellers. Subsequent reports by the Market Analysis\nDepartment and the Market Surveillance Committee of the California\nIndependent System Operator reach the same conclusions. Subsequent behavior\nof wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions, and\nsubjects California to further economic damage. While I remain hopeful that\nCalifornia wholesale markets may ultimately become competitive and become\ncapable of serving the interests of consumers and the public, I cannot and\nwill not accept the liabilities to California that result from the current\nsituation for even a short period. I intend to take any and all steps\nnecessary to restore economic stability to the electric service\ninfrastructure of California.\n\nFERC bears the responsibility under its organic act to assure just and\nreasonable wholesale electric rates. FERC bears responsibility to ensure\nthat a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and\nCalifornia's economy are subjected to unconstrained, market-based\nelectricity prices. Consequently, I renew my prior request that the\nCommission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible\nto restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have\nresulted from the exercise of market power.\n\n###\n\nOFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----\nA00:245\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nSeptember 12, 2000\n\nGOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S CLEAN ENERGY GREEN TEAM\nSACRAMENTO - Governor Gray Davis today announced the appointment of Michael\nA. Kahn as chairman of the newly-created Governor's Clean Energy Green Team.\nThe Team was created by Governor Davis' signing of AB 970 by Assemblywoman\nDenise Moreno Ducheny (D-San Diego) on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Kahn, 51, of San Francisco, is the chairman of the California\nElectricity Oversight Board, and he also serves as vice-chair of the\nCalifornia Commission on Judicial Performance. He has been senior partner\nand head of litigation at Folger Levin & Kahn LLP since 1979. Mr. Kahn has\nheld numerous state and federal government appointments and assignments over\nthe last 15 years.\n\nMr. Kahn is the author of several articles and reports on litigation\npractice and Supreme Court history. He is a magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa\ngraduate of the University of California, Los Angeles. Mr. Kahn also earned\nmaster of arts and juris doctorate degrees from Stanford University, where\nhe was an editor of the Law Review. After graduation, he served for a year\nas a law clerk to Judge Ben C. Duniway of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\nin San Francisco.\n\nThe signing of AB 970 established the Governor's Clean Energy Green Team,\nwhich works to streamline the process of creating new power plants to ensure\nthat an adequate supply of power will exist to make a deregulated\nmarketplace work. The Team does this by working with local governments,\nidentifying environmental impacts, developing recommendations for low\ninterest financing programs for renewable energy and obtaining input on\nnatural gas supply, emission offsets and water supply.\n\nMembers do not receive a salary. This position does not require Senate\nconfirmation.\n\n# # #\n\nJulee Malinowski-Ball\nEdson + Modisette\nAssociate\n925 L Street Suite 1490\nSacramento CA 95814\n916-552-7070\nFAX-552-7075\njmball@ns.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nSALEM, Ore. (AP) - Oregon's energy future may be chewing cud in Bernie \nFaber's pasture. \nHis 500 cows will provide tons of manure to be converted to methane to \ngenerate electricity in a pilot project operated by Portland General Electric.\nThe project is expected to generate about 100 kilowatts of electricity - \nenough for about 65 homes - by July. \n\"When you consider how many dairy farms there are in Oregon, this could be a \nsignificant source of power,\" said PGE spokesman Mark Fryburg. \nAbout 89,000 milk cows were reported on state farms in 1999. \nPGE wants to perfect the technology at Faber's Cal-Gon Farm. If the company \nsucceeds, small-scale power plants could become commonplace at Oregon dairy \nfarms. \n\"We would love to be able to engineer and design these things so we could do \nthem at smaller and smaller dairies over time,\" said Jeff Cole, PGE'; biogas \nprogram manger. \nPGE officials also are interested in developing a 4.5 megawatt, \nmethane-powered energy facility in Morrow County that could provide energy \nfor about 3,000 homes. It would depend on manure from dairies relocating to \nthe area to support a Tillamook County Creamery Association cheese plant. \nThe disposal of livestock waste has become an expensive and complex problem \nfor farms as environmental regulations tighten. \nA typical dairy cow produces about 150 pounds of waste each day. \nMethane-powered generators, such as PGE's project, reduce the odors \nassociated with dairies and create useful byproducts: a nitrogen-rich liquid \nfertilizer and an odorless dry fiber that can be used to make potting soils. \nAt Faber's farm, construction of a 28-foot high concrete tank where waste \nwill be converted into methane is nearly complete. \nPGE officials compare the tank to a giant stomach, where bacteria in manure \ncontinues the digestion process and produces flammable methane. \nA modified, internal combustion engine will burn the methane for fuel and \ndrive power turbines. After the manure is processed, the leftovers will be \npumped through a solid separator, taken off site, and composted. \nLiquids will be stored at a lagoon at the dairy.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Maybe over a\ncocktail.  I'm sure you will be both serious and concerned\n\nWhat you are doing is giving Brent his year end review and basically asking \nhim to fill in the details with\nactions over the next four to five months.\n\n1) Brent has a great opportunity to take his leadership skills to the next \nlevel and by focusing and delivering\nthese challenges he will solidify his core strengths in the eyes of others \nand most importantly himself.\n\n2)  You need for him to step up to the plate and fully support you by \ninsuring that he will \"take care of the\nbusiness, completely and totally.\"  No hits to the P & L,  zero tolerance for \nincompetency and complacency.\n\nYou can not do what you need to do Globally without the trust and confidence \nin his performance\n\nAdditionally he must identify and develop his successor.\n\nGet a covenant from Brent that his is fully committed to do the work\n\nAlso let him know you fully support him and will continue to back him fully \nin this effort as long as he does his\npart and keeps you informed.\n\nCall me if needed.\n\nTom\n\n\n\n\n\n - Sally Beck Notes for Brent Price August 2000.doc",

        "body": "Some ideas for Friday's comments - \n\nTwo of the Commission's stated goals in the ACR were:\n\nReduce the disparity in prices paid for energy among customer classes:  Enron \nsuggests a restatement of this goal.  Energy prices should be an accurate \nindication of the costs imposed on the system.  For example, the average cost \nof 1 kW @ 100% load factor is much different than 1 kW used at 30% load \nfactor, all on-peak, and much different than 1 kW used at 70% load factor, \nall off-peak.  In practice, each customer class has a mixture of customers \nleaning toward each of these extreme.  True equity requires that customers \nwith similar load patterns pay non-disparate energy prices, regardless of \nwhich class the customer is in.   A more proper statement of this goal is:  \nreduce the disparity between prices paid for energy and costs imposed on the \nsystem across all customer classes.  \n\nTier rates to promote conservation:  Enron suggests a restatement of this \ngoal. Traditionally, the California Commission has favored rate designs that \nreflect marginal costs.  Marginal cost pricing, in and of itself promotes \nefficient use of energy because of the many reasons the CPUC itself has cited \nover the years.  In the situation at hand,  the indicators of marginal cost \nin the wholesale power market are CDWR's purchase cost in hours when the CDWR \nis covering the net short, and the hourly wholesale spot market price (the \nwholesale on-peak forward curve, as a proxy)  in hours when the CDWR is not \nfilling the net short.  Conservation will be incented with use of price \nsignals that reflect market conditions.  A more proper statement of this goal \nis:  To provide customers with the motivation to respond appropriately, \ndesign marginal rates within the rate classes to reflect marginal wholesale \ncosts.\n\nRegarding these goals, it will take time for the commission and parties to do \nthis - which plays to EES URM and the idea of keeping the 3 cents as an \ninterim rate design while a 6 month rate design case can take place.  I think \nit is inconceivable, however, that the CPUC does not have strong price \nsignals in place for this summer.  So I think we use the \"equal percent of \nmarginal costs\" idea to get price signals in place, but much flatter ones \nthan in the ACR.  (for a variety of reasons, I don't think the 2-part real \ntime pricing being pushed by Mr. Stoness can fly without some radical \nmodifications, but let's talk).\n\nAbout the residential increase, we may want to weigh in on whether \nresidentail usage above 130% of baseline gets the full brunt of the total \nresidential increase or just 3 cents.  Let's talk about the politics.\n\nWe also will want to say 1) DA is exempt from the increase  2) any increase \nprior to the effective date of the new rate design should be 3 cents across \nthe board.",

We would only get a $20/MWh increase, as \ncompared to a $30/MWh increase.  ie (1-90%) times $300/MWh yields $30/MWh is \nour story when the actural is (1-90%)times $200/MWh yields $20/MWh.\nThe Enron rates below are effectively much flatter than the CPUC proposal.  \nThus we would be better off if accepted.\nAdditionally if our noise causes a flat $30/MWh increase to replace the CPUC \nproposal, we are better off.\n\nAdditionally, \nwe could sell hedging on the 10% exposed to markets.\nDSM related to capital investments should be less risky.\n\nThe risks to Enron are:\nProposal makes it easy to hit the large customers with a lower baseline (ie \n75% instead of 90%)\nWould make DSM more risky.  DSM providers would have to buy hedges to proceed.\n\nThe questions to answer are:\nCould Enron provide witnesses without drawing more negatives\nWould a partner tow the Enron line\n---------------------- Forwarded by Scott Stoness/HOU/EES on 04/02/2001 09:22 \nPM ---------------------------\n\n\nScott Stoness\n04/02/2001 09:21 PM\nTo: Tamara Johnson/HOU/EES@EES\ncc: harry kingerski \nSubject: Draft Testimony re PGE/SCE for Discussion\n\nSummary:\nThe CPUC should implement two part RTP/TOU rates for PGE/SCE.  A two part \nrate is a rate where customers pay their historical rate for consumption of \nnormal load and pay market value for consumption incremental (or decremental) \nto normal load.\nThe CPUC should define normal consumption as consumption over and above 90% \nof historical 2000 consumption.\nThe CPUC should define the hourly rate as the highest hourly price paid by \nDWR for spot purchases in that hour.\nIn the event that implementation of two part RTP/TOU rates is complicated to \ndesign, the $30/MWh surcharge should be applied to all customers until the \nimplementation of two part RTP/TOU rates is possible.\nThe current draft design, of the CPUC, is discriminatory to large customers.\nThe current draft design, of the CPUC, does not provide appropriate price \nsignals.\nThe current draft design, of the CPUC, results in rate increases to large \ncustomers that are unneccessarly high.\nThe current draft design, of the CPUC, results in rate increases to large \ncustomers, that are far in excess of those which the CPUC intended.\nThe current draft design, of the CPUC, results is static and does not respond \nto changing market conditions.\n\nDesign Goals:\nThe CPUC should design rates that:\nGive appropriate price signals to customers to consume / conserve energy as \nas close to marginal price as possible in as many hours as possible.\nTreat all rate classes in a fair and consistent manner.\nAchieve targeted revenue requirements.\nAre easy to administer and understand.\n\nSummary of CPUC Illustrative Design:\nThe CPUC has proposed rates that move on peak pricing in the summer close to \nmarginal rates:\nDraft proposal provides marginal price signal of about $370/MWh for E19 \nSecondary from in Summer Weekdays from noon to 6PM\nDraft proposal provides marginal price signal of about $75/MWh for E19 \nSecondary from in all other hours.\nCritique based on Design Goals:\nDraft proposals move toward marginal rates but fall short.\nThe rates for power, Mar 30 2001, based on DJ-NP15, on peak is $181.94/MWh.\nThe rates for power, Mar 30 2001, based on DJ-NP15, off peak is $93.46/MWh.\nThe proposed marginal rates for E19 Secondary, is $75/MWh for on peak and off \npeak.\nThis rate design will not encourage investments in assets that result in \nlower consumption in the winter or in off peak periods.\n Draft proposal falls short on treating customers on a consistent basis:\nE20 Transmission Voltage customers will experience a 87% rate increase.\nE19 Secondary voltage customers will experience a 41% rate increase.\nA10 Medium General Service customers will experience a 20% rate increase.\nA1 Small L&P customers will experience a 16% rate increase.\nThe marginal price signal for A10 will be $121/MWh vs $370/MWh for E-20 \ntransmission in the on peak summer.\nThe marginal price signal for E10 wills be 107/MWh vs $55/MWh for E-20 \ntransmission in the off peak periods.\nPGE has a longer summer period than SCE.  This results in a 69% increase for \nSCE TOU-8-Sub as compared to 87% increases for PGE E20 Transmission rate.  \nThe proposal also results in far different marginal price signals for SCE \ncustomers than PGE customers.  For example the on peak rate for SCE TOU-8-Sub \nis $128/MWh as compared to PGE E20 Transmission rate of $374/MWh.\nDraft proposal does do a good job of recovering $2.2b of revenue.\nDraft proposal require some implementation but given that the surcharge \nincrease does not ocur until May for PGE and June for SCE, it should be \npossible to implement.\n\nEnron Proposed Rates:\nEnron proposes:\nTwo part real time pricing time of use rate,\nUsage up to 90% of historical use would be billed at historical rates.\nUsage incremental or decremental to 90% of historical use, would be billed at \nDJ-NP15 On Peak and DJ-NP15 Off Peak, where customers has real time metering.\nUsage incremental or decremental to 90% of historical use, would be billed at \nDJ-NP15 On Peak and DJ-NP15 Off Peak averaged over the month, where customers \nhas time of use metering.\nUsage incremental or decremental to 90% of historical use, would be billed at \n45% of DJ-NP15 On Peak and 55% of DJ-NP15 Off Peak averaged over the month, \nwhere customers has just energy metering.\nCritique based on Design Goals:\nEnron proposals charge all customer at very close  to marginal rates.\nThus, within the constraints of using Dow Jones, the rates should be very \nclose to the actual marginal rates.\nThe rates will not be exact because they are:\nDetermined on the previous day\nOny differentiate between on and off peak, as compared to hour by hour.\nTo the extent that the customer does not have real time metering capability, \nthe rates will be determined on a class average basis.\nHowever, the rates be far superior to the CPUC draft design because:\nThey give better price signals to night consumption\nThey give better signals to weekend consumption\nThey give better signals to winter consumption\nThey are self correcting in that they do not require predetermination of \nmarginal costs.  For example, if summer costs are lower, the rate will be \nlower.\nThe Enron proposal will motivate DSM activities in winter, summer and off \npeak.\nEnron proposal results in similar rate structure and impact regardless of \nutility and rate class.\nThe Enron proposal results in a similar concept for commerical and industrial \nas with residential.  AB1X provides that residential customers that consume \nenergy below normal rates will not have increased rates.  This design also \nachieves the same effect for commercial and industrial customers.\nDraft proposal does do a good job of recovering $2.2b of revenue but even \nmore importantly it ensures tracking of costs.\nSetting the normal load at 90% of historical load results in a $30/MWh \nincrease if the market value for the entire year is $300/MWh.\nIn the event that the market value for the entire year is less than $300/MWh, \nthe resulting cost decreases will offset the lost revenue.\nThe Enron proposed rate design structure is flexi ble enough that it can \neasily be changed to achieve greater or lessor revenue to achieve price \nsignals and revenue targets.\nThe revenue outcome is less certain than the CPUC draft design however the \nimpact should be more certain because the revenue will automatically go up \nwhen the costs go up.\nDraft proposal require greater implementation details than the CPUC design \nbut such extra costs are worthwhile.\nThe Enron proposal requires:\nDetermination of historical loads for large customers\nDetermination of class consumption profiles for demand metered customers\nDetermination of class consumption profiles for energy metered customers\nDetermination of customer profiles in the event that the customers is a new \ncustomer\nThen Enron proposal has the following negatives:\nSome customers who have reduced load from historical levels will be better \noff even though they have not changed their behaviour in response to the new \nprice signals\nThe rates will require greater administrative costs since they are different \nfor each customer.\nThe rates may take more work to put in place for the utility\nThe rates will result in similar customers paying dissimilar rates, depending \nupon the historical consumption of the customers\n\nQ.  In the event that it is not possible to implement the Enron rates by June \n1, 2001, what would you propose a an interim solution:\nA.  The CPUC draft rates are so flawed, that it would be superior to just \nimplement a flat $30/MWh surcharge to all customers.  This approach would be \nfairer and simpler.\n\nQ.  Who would pay for the decremental consumption of customers?\nA.  The DWR will incur a decline in their costs equal to the decrease in \nrates of the utilities.  The are indifferent to buy more generation or \nselling less energy to customers.  Thus the DWR should be willing to pay for \ndecremental consumption.  In the event that the DWR is not agreeable to \npaying for decremental consumption, the utility should be allowed to borrow \nsuch funds and have the costs amortized for the next 10 years.  In the event \nthat the utility is unable to fund decremental consumption, the normal load \ncould be defined 85% of historical and the CPUC could eliminate credits \nresulting from decremental consumption.  Such solution would discourage \nconservation below 15% but would not be expected to diminish the \neffectiveness of the Enron proposed rates.\n\nQ.  Why is DJ-NP15 the right index to choose?\nA.  DJ-NP15 and DJ-SP15 are availble for each weekday for on and off peak \npricing.  The index is a mathematical average of trades in the previous day \nfor today.  The DJ index is compiled based on the information provided by \nmany of the large trading companies including Enron.  The numbers provided by \nthe participants are subject to audit.  Thus DJ is the best avaible \ninformation available for energy pricing.\n\nQ.  What index is suitable for weekends?\nA.

In very big ways!  In fact,\nTelluride has received over 3 feet of fresh powder since October 1 and the\ntemperatures have been frigid?which makes for excellent snowmaking\nconditions. Winter has come, and you know what that means ? YES! Time to\nstrap on some boards and make some turns!\n\n\nSNOW REPORT\nAs the snow has begun to come with increasing regularity, you can imagine\nthe local attitude begins to buoy. At lunch the other day, when we looked\nout the window and saw the big flakes coming down, we made a loud whoop\nwith our waiter, causing all heads in the restaurant to turn our way. But\nwhen the other diners saw the white stuff, EVERYONE started buzzing with\nthe anticipation. Folks are getting ready for the season. For a sneak\npreview, check out the photo of the day at\nwww.telluride-ski.com/dayphoto.html.\n\n\nBARGAINS & DEALS\nThe best-case scenario for skiing Telluride is to live here. But the NEXT\nbest-case scenario is that you get a screaming deal to vacation here. And\nthat's what Telluride and Mountain Village Visitor Services has for you.\nCheck out these packages for round-trip air, lodging and skiing from some\nof America's biggest hubs:\n\nDallas Special:          $831 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing\nand roundtrip air to Montrose\nHouston Special:    $814 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and\nroundtrip air to Montrose\nChicago Special:    $825 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and\nroundtrip air to Montrose\nMiami Special:      $929 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and\nroundtrip air to Montrose\n\nTo get any of these specials, call 1-888-288-7360.\n\nIf you choose to put together a package on your own, check out the lodging\ndeals at www.telluride-ski.com and click on HOT DEALS.\n\n\nWHAT'S NEW\nYou can never have too much snow. With that in mind, the Telluride Ski\nResort installed a new snowmaking system this summer that guarantees that\nevery lift pod will have coverage on at least one run all season long! Yep.\nLifts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 will have better conditions for riding and skiing\nfrom beginning to end. As the hipper folks say, the turns will be \"tasty.\"\n\nThe tastiest new addition to the mountain, however, is Allred's, a new\n140-seat restaurant that is guaranteed to delight even the most\ndiscriminating diners. Located mid-mountain at the gondola Station St.\nSophia, Allred's will serve as a private club by day in the winter, an\nupscale lunch spot in the summer and a fine dining experience in the\nevenings year-round. More on this epicurean dream in later e-rides. For\ndinner reservations, call 970-728-7474.\n\nOne other great new thing: It's easier to get to Telluride than ever\nbefore. You can now fly to Montrose EVERY DAY from Dallas/Ft. Worth on\nAmerican Airlines?but the flight will only have 129 seats, so be sure your\nbody is in one of them!\n\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENING\nOf course the most important thing on the Telluride calendar is November\n22, the Official Opening Day. But there are other things worth mentioning.\nLike the Sneak Preview of the mountain on November 21. For one day only you\ncan ski Telluride for $20, and all proceeds go to the Telluride Ski and\nSnowboard Club.\n\nAfter the Donation Day, you can still get good deals. From November 21\nthrough December 16, Telluride hosts its annual Ski Free & More program.\nWhat's it entail? Exactly what it says. Skiers and riders staying at\nparticipating lodges in the towns of Telluride and Mountain Village can\nchoose a free lift ticket, a free ski clinic, a free lunch or a free\nhalf-day of childcare for each night they stay. For more information call\n888-288-7360.\n\nAnd if you're looking forward to having a ball, why not do it right at the\nannual Black & White Affair? On November 25, the Telluride Ski and\nSnowboard Club hosts this gala event at the luxurious Telluride Conference\nCenter. Dress up and dance off your turkey. No one puts on a ball like\nTelluride!\n\n\nSLICE OF LIFE\nImagine being over 50 years old and never having seen any snow! Such was\nthe case for my friend Sarah, who recently moved to Telluride from the\nCaribbean. She and her daughters arrived late this summer, and when the\nsnows began to fall a few weeks ago, they were in rapture! Sarah ran\noutside and began to dance around (to her 17-year-old daughter's absolute\nembarrassment!) However, the daughters both caught the enthusiasm and built\ntheir first snowman ever. The snowman , of course, had a perfect carrot\nnose.. An organic carrot, no less. Hey, this is Telluride. Only the best\nfor our snowmen.\n\n\nAND SO, E-RIDERS,\nThat's all for this letter. Hope you're planning your trip to Telluride,\nwhere the snow is always whiter and the lines are always short. See you on\nthe slopes!\n\nRosemerry\n\n\nWHO'S WRITING THIS ANYWAY?\nAgainst her will, Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer learned to ski in Telluride six\nyears ago. But after a few turns, she fell ? in love with the sport. She\nlives with her husband and cat at the base of Lift 7?an ideal spot for\ngetting first chair of the morning.\n\n",

It acted as a=20\r\nmarket maker, purchasing storage capacity from StorageNetworks - which was=\r\n=20\r\nthen sold on to Best Buy, a retailer of electronics products.  Crucially,=\r\n=20\r\nboth contracts were based on Enron's standard contract and included firm=20\r\ndelivery with liquidated damages.\r\n\r\nIn the last few years the storage market has moved from being a self-manage=\r\nd=20\r\nand owned business to one where storage is served up from a standard metro=\r\n=20\r\nnetwork.  Enron's involvement will be bring flexibility of contract offerin=\r\ng=20\r\nand imbedded optionality, according to Ravi Thuraisingham, a senior trader =\r\nat=20\r\nEnron.  \"When we sell the product to the customer we remain in the market t=\r\no=20\r\nbuy the capacity back should they wish to unwind their position later.  Tha=\r\nt=20\r\nis unprecedented,\" says Thuraisingham. =20\r\n\r\nThe storage market has historically been more flexible and more committed t=\r\no=20\r\nfirm delivery than the bandwidth market, but these trades mark a significan=\r\nt=20\r\ndevelopment.  Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to=20\r\nfavour discounts on future purchases.  \"There is a premium in the price for=\r\n=20\r\nfirm delivery,\" says Thuraisingham.\r\n\r\nHe says that a number of other market participants are eager to commit to=\r\n=20\r\nEnron as a market maker.  In addition, equipment vendors are excited by the=\r\n=20\r\npossibilities of the market.  \"most storage equipment at the moment is=20\r\nsupplied to the enterprise market.  This development opens up the wholesale=\r\n=20\r\nstorage capacity market,\" says Thuraisingham.  =20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary/March 2001 Issue\r\n\r\nRoundtable Preview\r\n\r\nMarcello Romano, EBS vice-president bandwidth trading in London, is=20\r\nparticipating in a roundtable on the development of the bandwidth trading=\r\n=20\r\nmarket.  Other participants include TFS Telecom Division, Williams=20\r\nCommunications, Dynegy Global Communications, France Telecom and Telemonde=\r\n=20\r\nNetworks.  Following are his initial comments to Telecoms Capacity:\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcello Romano is vice president bandwidth trading at Enron Broadband=20\r\nServices in London, arguably one of the most important players in the=20\r\ncommoditisation of the market.=20\r\n\r\nThe concept of firmness of delivery will encourage more participants in the=\r\n=20\r\nlong term. What is important to realise is that firmness doesn=01,t mean=20\r\ndelivery tomorrow. All it means is that if you commit to a date and then fa=\r\nil=20\r\nto deliver on that date you must pay damages. These are not punitive, they=\r\n=20\r\nare fair. In the telecoms sector, damages are usually payable in credits, b=\r\nut=20\r\nit=01,s important that any damages go above what was originally paid in tha=\r\nt=20\r\ncontract. Otherwise, there is no contractual incentive for the carrier to=\r\n=20\r\ndeliver on time or at all. =20\r\n=01; =01;\r\nThe downturn in investors=01, appetite to put money into telecoms companies=\r\n will=20\r\nhasten a trading culture. The carriers already trade capacity between=20\r\nthemselves to allow them to sell services. As investment for expansion=20\r\ndeclines, these options will become more attractive. But it generally still=\r\n=20\r\nmakes sense to build rather than buy where there is volume.\r\n=01; =01;\r\nPooling points are the logical conclusion to the problems of connectivity.=\r\n=20\r\nMetro platforms are a key feature of a number of carriers=01, strategies be=\r\ncause=20\r\nthey help you get around a lot of local loop issues and offer increased=20\r\naccess to buyers and sellers. Carriers are currently trying to build to as=\r\n=20\r\nmany telehouses within a metro area as possible, because no-one wants to be=\r\n=20\r\ntied. The pooling point concept takes that to a logical conclusion. It is=\r\n=20\r\nmore economical to create a hub that can then connect to all the telehouses=\r\n=20\r\nthrough the networks of the carriers involved. It=01,s efficient and fairly=\r\n=20\r\ncheap to connect. The idea that people don=01,t want to be involved with po=\r\noling=20\r\npoints because it=01,s a link you can=01,t control is nonsense. Carriers co=\r\nnnect=20\r\nwith third parties such as CLECs all the time and rely on them to complete =\r\na=20\r\nroute. It=01,s not a revolution, it=01,s an evolution.\r\n=01; =01;\r\nYou can be a player without owning a network. In Europe, Enron has no fibre=\r\n=20\r\nnetwork and is involved in the buy and the sell side of the market. That=01=\r\n,s a=20\r\npositive development, which reinforces the model we=01,re trying to build. =\r\nA lot=20\r\nof players spend a lot of money finding and closing simple transactions. We=\r\n=20\r\ncan help them do it cheaper and allow their sales force to concentrate on=\r\n=20\r\nhigher value-added sales.

Another notable attendee was Corbin McNeill, CEO of \nExelon.  It turned out that just about the entire discussion centered around \nenergy and they strongly stated that the RGA is going to be very active in \nthe western energy issues.  \n\nStrategically this is good for us.  Although the WGA was the vehicle for the \npast 2 months (Kempthorne and Geringer are the chair/vice chair), it is now \nclear that the leadership of the RGA (Ridge, Rowland) will be helping the \n\"steer the ship\".  Although not talked about publically, I had a conversation \nwith one of the governor's staffers (Scott Celley from Hull's office), and he \nis likely going to be the RGA policy guy on this effort,  having direct and \ndaily contact with the Cheney energy team.  Paul and I have developed a \nrelationship with him and he is going to be looking to us for further \nsupport/info/talking points etc.\n\nLastly, it is important to note that Corbin McNeill was singing exactly the \nsame song as us on the price caps and western issues.   Additionally,  Mr. \nLay asked him point blank--twice in fact--if he was for full and open non \ndiscriminatory access to the transmission system and he stated that he was.  ",

This is a strategic \ninitative requested by the commercial teams as well as Causey.  This \nabsolutely must be in place by the end of the year.\n\nEssentially, there are three main areas:\n\ndevelop global (minimum) standards\ndevelop & implement exception reporting to these standards\ndevelop & implement global operation reporting\n\nI have put together milestones for us to work by in these projects:\n\nGlobal operating performance\n\nThis  will be the monthly reporting package.  Currently we do this for N. \nAmerica.  We need to establish a reporting format for the products/locations \ncurrently not included in this package.  The package is not intended to be \nincorporated into the current package, but use it as a guide to create our \nown.\n\nTimeline:\nAug 31 - Finalize what will be reported\nSept 15 - Finalize reporting lines (who we are getting this info from @ each \nlocation and who is receiving and consolidating it)\nSept 30 - Close of business for sept 30 we should have our first consolidated \nreporting package to report\nOct 30 - Collect feedback from 1st reporting package and redesign reporting \nif necessary (continual improvements)\n\nGlobal standards time line (daily reporting)\n\nThis will be the exception reporting based on the global standards we \ncreate.  This will be a daily reporting package.\n\nTimeline:\nAugust 31 - finalize global standards into 2 buckets\nQuantitative (to be reported daily)\nQualitative (to be reviewed within doorstep reviews)\nSept 15 - Establish measurable targets for quantitative standards\nSept 30 - Finalize reporting format for quantitative reporting lines (who do \nwe get it from, who consolidates it, who sees it, how often)\nNov 30 - Have reporting implemented - start reporting\n\nRegards\n\nSHona\n\nPS - I'm also working on developing a monthly reporting summary for each \noffice concerning what the latest developements are, much like they have in \nLondon.  I have Maria working on developing a list of all offices.",

The request will be sent to the TAC where it \nwill have an e-mail vote and I would not anticipate any opposition. \n\nTo receive the \"provisional authorization\" the QSE needs to have performed an \nAncillary Services qualification test in good faith but failed to qualify due \nto problems that in the opinion of ERCOT, are noncritical for providing one \nor more ancillary services.  My understanding is that Frontera has not had \nthe primary test.  According to John Adams at ERCOT four have been scheduled \nand subsequently cancelled.  It will be critical to schedule and complete the \ntest to be considered for the \"provisional authorization\".  \n\nI spoke with John Adams regarding staffing to help perform the qualification \ntests and he said that they would be able to do the certification tests at \nabout any time without any major scheduling delays.  The only time when they \nwould not be able to do the tests would be when ESCA will take control of the \nsystems to perform cut-over operations. \n\nThane Thomas Twiggs\nEnron Corp\n1400 Smith Street\nHouston, Texas 77002\n\n713-853-3199 Voice\n713-408-4463 Mobile\n713-646-8272 Fax\n877-968-8967 Digital Pager or 8779688967@skytel.com\n",

On Tuesday, state regulators approved an average 40 percent \nincrease in consumer electricity rates to cover the soaring cost of energy \nand pump more cash into the state's near-bankrupt utilities. \n\n     \"The energy crisis in California has ramifications for the entire \ncountry, and it looks like it's going to get worse before it gets better,\" \nRep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican who heads the panel, said in a \nstatement. \n\n     \"The problems are costing California's economy billions of dollars, and \nthat's going to affect the economy of the entire country,\" he added. \n\n     The committee will hear testimony from power generators, utilities, \ngovernment entities, and local organizations. \n\n     Neighboring states have complained that California's thirst for power \nhas boosted wholesale electricity prices throughout the western region, \nforcing some energy-intensive businesses like paper mills and mines to \ntemporarily close. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\nCopyright , 2001 Reuters Limited. \n\n",

Socal made a payment on \nWednesday of  $43.5M for purchases between January 19 - February 11 and PG&E \npaid $61M.\n? Attorney General, Bill Lockyer, has ruled that the media does not have the \nright to view the long-term power contracts being negotiated.\n? Senator Burton stated on the Senate Floor this morning that legislators \nneed to set their regular session bill unrelated to energy quickly because \nthere would be no rule waivers.  He also noted that there would probably not \nbe a lot of money for anything besides energy, and therefore a lot of bills \nwould probably die in policy committee.\n? In a conference call on Tuesday, SoCal stated to a group of commercial \npaper holders that it would pay back interest on its commercial paper, which \nis approximately $30M.  One commercial holder said that since there is no \ndefault rate specified in the paper, the default rate should automatically be \n10% under California  law.  The SoCal representative replied \"we don't think \nthat applies to us.\"  In other words, SoCal does not plan on paying an added \ndefault rate on top of the interest payments.\n? At this time, the Legislature announced they would probably not be taking \ntheir Easter break, scheduled for the week of April 9th.  According to a \nsource, Burton is not allowing any passes for any travel or absences.  \nHertzberg has gone a step farther and said that any travel has to approved by \nhis office and the member themselves has to come to his office to pick up the \ntickets.  Some believe this maybe an attempt to push the Republicans into \nbreaking the stalemate on AB 8X (voted down last Friday)currently being \ndebated in the Assembly.  \n",

He \nhad been in both Dallas and Miami's camps during the season. Spotwood has no \nFantasy value.   \n\n Mike Alstott , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 \n Alstott could be back in practice on Thursday, a full two weeks ahead of \nschedule in his return from a sprained knee. If all goes well, he could play \nin the Monday night game against St. Louis, or at worst, the season finale \nagainst Green Bay on December 24. It's probably best to keep Alstott on your \nbench during the Fantasy playoffs, although there's an outside shot he could \nmake an impact during the final game if he gets into the swing of things \nquickly.  \n\n Chad Morton , RB NO - Fear Updated 12/12/00 \n Morton is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Atlanta with a \nseparated shoulder, although he was able to play with a shoulder injury last \nSunday. We don't recommend him for your Fantasy playoffs.  \n\n Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 \n Head Coach Jim Haslett says he hopes to re-sign Moore, who was placed on \nwaivers on Saturday. Moore became expendable with the addition of veteran \nTerry Allen, and won't have any Fantasy value even if he returns.  \n\n Matt Hatchette , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 \n Hatchette injured the oblique muscle above his hip during last Sunday's game \nagainst St. Louis. He's listed as day to day, but is expected to play Sunday \nagainst Green Bay. He's not someone who will help your Fantasy team much, \nthough.  \n\n Chris Walsh , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 \n Walsh is unlikely to play Sunday against Green Bay after he underwent \nsurgery on Tuesday on a broken bone in his left cheek. He suffered the injury \nduring last Sunday's game against St. Louis but finished the game. Walsh has \nbeen valuable to the Vikings on special teams and as the No. 4 receiver, but \nhe's not a viable Fantasy option.  \n\n Fred Taylor , RB JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/12/00 \n The Jaguars will need to evaluate Taylor's sprained left knee during \npractice this week before determining his status for Sunday's game against \nCincinnati. He suffered the injury during the third quarter of last Sunday's \ngame, which was his seventh straight with at least 100 rushing yards. \nHopefully Taylor will be able to play, as he's among the best options at \nrunning back during the Fantasy playoffs.  \n\n Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 \n Northcutt will miss Cleveland's final game of the season Sunday against \nTennessee due to a sprained ankle. Believe it or not, this likely hurts the \nBrowns' quarterbacking situation most, as he was rotating in that slot last \nSunday against Philadelphia. It's best to avoid any Cleveland players at this \nstage of the Fantasy season.  \n\n Curtis Enis , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 \n Enis, who missed last Sunday's game against New England due to a reaction to \nan over-the-counter flu medicine, was feeling better Monday. Still, his \nstatus for Sunday's game against San Francisco is unknown, so it's best to \nkeep him on your bench this week.  \n\n Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 \n Bears Coach Dick Jauron may give Matthews the start at quarterback on Sunday \nagainst San Francisco, instead of giving Cade McNown the final two starts. \nOne possible reason for that may be that Matthews aggravated an injury when \nhe was rushed back last season, and Jauron didn't want the same to happen to \nMcNown. We don't recommend either quarterback this week, despite him facing \nthe weak Niners' pass defense.   \n\n Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00 \n Biakabutuka, who has missed four games with turf toe, may be able to \npractice on Wednesday. Even if he is able to play Sunday against San Diego, \nwe wouldn't recommend Biakabutuka the remainder of the season.  \n\n Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Fear Updated 12/12/00 \n Although he's most likely the quarterback for 2001, Beuerlein might be \nbenched for backup Jeff Lewis for part of Carolina's final two games. Nothing \nis worse than a part-time quarterback for your Fantasy playoffs, so steer \nclear of both players if at all possible.  \n\n Jeff Lewis , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 \n Coach George Seifert says that he may give Lewis some playing time over the \nfinal two games, although he has endorsed Steve Beuerlein as the starter for \n2001. Lewis has a high cost against the cap, so the Panthers need to \ndetermine soon whether he's the quarterback of the future. On the other hand, \nBeuerlein has the third-longest consecutive-starts streak in the league at QB \nand may not want to end it. Lewis isn't someone we'd recommend during your \nFantasy playoffs, whether he starts or not.  \n\n Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 \n German was unable to practice Monday, and may be placed on injured reserve \non Tuesday with a badly sprained left ankle. He has no Fantasy value.  \n\n Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 12/12/00 \n The Bills' defense has been ravaged by injuries this season, and it \ncertainly showed on Monday night. Although Indianapolis did score two \ndefensive touchdowns in the game, Buffalo's D still gave up 30 points to \nIndy. Once a solid defensive unit, the Bills are now just a shell of their \nformer selves and shouldn't be considered a starting defensive squad on your \nFantasy team.   \n\n Steve Christie , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 \n Christie made up for his scoreless performance last week with two field \ngoals on Monday night, including a 46-yard boot in the second quarter. He is \none of the best placekickers in the league, and should be considered a weekly \nstarter on your Fantasy team.   \n\n Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - FDIC Updated 12/12/00 \n The Bills' young wideout has only 12 receptions in his last six games and \nhasn't seen the end zone since Week Three against the Jets. What little \nFantasy value he may have had early in the season is all but gone now.   \n\n Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 \n Vanderjagt converted on all three of his field goal attempts in Monday \nnight's win over Buffalo. He is one of the NFL's most accurate kickers, \nmissing only two field goals the entire season. Starting Vanderjagt this week \nis a good idea against a tough Miami defesne that doesn't allow many \ntouchdowns.   \n\n Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 \n Pollard hasn't had more than two catches in any game in the last four weeks, \nand hasn't scored a touchdown since Week Five. Translation: Avoid starting \nPollard at all costs for the duration of your Fantasy season.   \n\n Ken Dilger , TE IND - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/12/00 \n With only seven receptions in the last four weeks, including only one on \nMonday night, Dilger has become a Fantasy afterthought. Avoid starting him if \nyour roster allows it.  \n\n Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 \n Pathon caught three passes for 31 yards on Monday night against the Bills. \nAt this point in the season, Pathon has no Fantasy value.   \n\n Eric Moulds , WR BUF - FDIC Updated 12/12/00 \n Moulds had another sub-par performance on Monday night, catching only two \npasses for 47 yards in the Bills' loss to Indianapolis. In the last two \nweeks, Moulds has caught only four balls for 58 yards and no touchdowns. \nFantasy owners who have Moulds should continue starting him in the Fantasy \nplayoffs and hope that he can break out of this semi-slump.    \n\n Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00 \n Wilkins came back down to earth after last week's 109-yard, one touchdown \nperformance against the Jets, catching only two passes for 37 yards on Monday \nnight. Wilkins has been far more effective on special teams than as a \nreceiver in recent weeks, so don't expect much production in the final two \nweeks of the season.    \n\n Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Lie Downs Updated 12/12/00 \n To the disbelief of many Fantasy owners, Harrison was held in check in \nMonday night's game with the Bills. He caught only two passes for 27 yards \nagainst what was an injury-depleted Buffalo secondary - a performance which \nmay have helped keep some owners from moving on in their playoffs. If you \nwere lucky enough to advance, Harrison is still a must start, even against \nthe Colts' next opponent, the Miami Dolphins. In the team's first meeting, \nHarrison scorched the Fish for 74 yards receiving and two scores.     \n\n Peerless Price , WR BUF - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00 \n Price had his best performance of the season on Monday night, catching four \npasses for 93 yards and a touchdown in Buffalo's loss to the Colts. These \nwere the types of numbers that Fantasy owners were expecting all season from \nPrice, but they are still too little, too late to consider him for your \nstarting lineup.   \n\n Sammy Morris , RB BUF - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 \n Morris returned to limited duty on Monday night after missing two games with \nan ankle injury. He accounted for 34 yards of total offense and a touchdown \nin the Bills' 44-20 loss. Morris will likely be splitting time with Shawn \nBryson in the backfield, so it's a good idea to avoid starting either of \nBuffalo's tailbacks at this point.  \n\n Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Meximullets Updated 12/12/00 \n Bryson got the majority of the carries against the Colts on Monday night, \nrushing the ball 15 times for 45 yards.  His main production, however, came \nthrough the air, where he caught six passes for 75 yards. Bryson's 120 yards \nof total offense is impressive, but he still isn't a viable option for \nFantasy owners at this point in the season.    \n\n Edgerrin James , RB IND - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 \n \"The Edge\" had a terrific Fantasy performance on Monday night, compiling 132 \nyards of total offense and three touchdowns in the Colts' big win over \nBuffalo. James will face a Miami squad that gave up 118 yards rushing to him \nback in Week 12, but also kept him out of the end zone. When it comes really \ncomes down to it, the Colts could be facing the 1985 Bears' defense and it \nwouldn't matter - James is a must start for the duration of the Fantasy \nplayoffs.  \n\n Peyton Manning , QB IND - The Lie Downs Updated 12/12/00 \n Manning had a very un-Peyton like performance on Monday night, completing \n13-of-24 passes for only 132 yards and no touchdowns in the Colts' 44-20 win. \nIt was the first time this season that Manning was held with out at least one \ntouchdown pass in a game. If your team survived Manning's poor Fantasy \nperformance, you may not like his team's next opponent - Miami. The Dolphins \nhave two of the best corners in the game in Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison, \nso it isn't out of the question for Manning to have another sub-par \nperformance. At this point in the season, it is a good idea to stick with the \nformer Vols star and hope he can have a more typical Peyton Manning day.    \n\n Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 \n Huard is expected to miss another game while recovering from a bruised \nkidney this week. Jon Kitna will start again and might make several turnovers \nagainst an opportunistic Oakland defense.  \n\nMore Updates \n\n Rosters?Teams? \n\n\n [IMAGE]\n[IMAGE]\n Meximullets \n Eric Bass \n\n\n\n  Player  \n  TM  \n  Pos  \n  Status  \n  Next  \n  Bye  \n  Garcia, Jeff  \n SF \n QB \n Active \n CHI \n  Week 13  \n Davis, Stephen  \n WAS \n RB \n Active \n @PIT \n  Week 11  \n Garner, Charlie  \n SF \n RB \n Active \n CHI \n  Week 13  \n Holt, Torry  \n STL \n WR \n Active \n @TB \n  Week 6  \n Toomer, Amani  \n NYG \n WR \n Active \n @DAL \n  Week 8  \n Freeman, Antonio  \n GB \n WR \n Active \n @MIN \n  Week 8  \n Brady, Kyle  \n JAC \n TE \n Active \n @CIN \n  Week 10  \n Anderson, Gary  \n MIN \n K \n Active \n GB \n  Week 4  \n Ravens  \n BAL \n DT \n Active \n @ARI \n  Week 14  \n McNabb, Donovan  \n PHI \n QB \n Reserve \n bye \n  Week 16  \n Hicks, Skip  \n WAS \n RB \n Reserve \n @PIT \n  Week 11  \n Bryson, Shawn  \n BUF \n RB \n Reserve \n NE \n  Week 4  \n Autry, Darnell  \n PHI \n RB \n Reserve \n bye \n  Week 16  \n Watson, Justin  \n STL \n RB \n Reserve \n @TB \n  Week 6  \n Schroeder, Bill  \n GB \n WR \n Reserve \n @MIN \n  Week 8  \n Robinson, Marcus  \n CHI \n WR \n Reserve \n @SF \n  Week 9  \n Redskins  \n WAS \n DT \n Reserve \n @PIT \n  Week 11  \n\nTotal Active Players: 9\nTotal Reserve Players: 8\n\n  NFL Injuries for Meximullets  \n\n  Updated  \n  Player  \n  Team  \n  Pos  \n  Injury  \n  Expected Return  \n 12/12/00 \n  Autry, Darnell  \n PHI \n RB \n Shoulder \n Probable vs. Cin (Dec. 24) \n 12/4/00 \n  Robinson, Marcus  \n CHI \n WR \n Back \n Out for the rest of the season \n\n\n View?Transactions? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[IMAGE]?

Pure\n                    Wind(SM) certificates correspond to the\n                    environmental attributes associated with equivalent\n                    amounts of wind-generated electricity delivered to\n                    the New York power pool. \n\n                    Because wind-generated electricity has no air\n                    emissions, the avoided emissions may be\n                    compared to the pollution emitted by the average of\n                    all New York State power generation facilities. On\n                    this basis, total electricity output for the Madison\n                    Windpower facility in an average year will avoid\n                    12,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), 65 tons of\n                    sulfur dioxide (SO2), and 19 tons of nitrogen oxide\n                    (NOx). \n\n                    Pure Wind(SM) certificates will also be available to\n                    consumers through a web-based sales site at\n                    http://www.purewind.net, currently under\n                    development. \n\n                    \"Wind power is a commercially available,\n                    economically viable and completely renewable\n                    energy source,\" said Iribe. \"This project puts\n                    Madison on the map as an innovative leader in the\n                    development of renewable energy; and by\n                    supporting this project, New York has jumped to the\n                    forefront in demonstrating its commitment to\n                    improved air quality,\" he added. \n\n                    To further the process of bringing renewable power\n                    to New York State, the New York State Energy\n                    Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA)\n                    awarded the Madison Windpower Project a\n                    research and development contract. \n\n                    \"As NYSERDA celebrates its 25th anniversary this\n                    week, how fitting it is for us to be here today\n                    celebrating the opening of the largest wind power\n                    plant in the Northeast,\" said Parker D. Mathusa, a\n                    member of NYSERDA's Board of Directors.\n                    \"NYSERDA's mission over those years has been to\n                    use innovation and technology to help solve the\n                    State's energy and environmental problems, which\n                    is exactly what we are doing here today as we bring\n                    clean power to the market place.\" \n\n                    The Madison project joins one of the nation's\n                    fast-growing power generation sectors. According to\n                    the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA),\n                    capacity from windpower plants has nearly doubled\n                    in the last 10 years. Currently, installed windpower\n                    facilities supply nearly 2,650 megawatts of capacity\n                    to U.S. markets. \n\n                    With wind speeds between eight and twenty miles\n                    per hour, Madison will supply enough emission-free\n                    electricity to power approximately 10,000 homes. \n\n                    PG&E Corporation with 1999 revenues of nearly $21\n                    billion and operations in 21 states, markets energy\n                    services and products throughout North America\n                    through its National Energy Group. \n\n                    The Corporation has ownership and management\n                    interests in 30 operating electric power generating\n                    plants in 10 states, providing it with a generation\n                    portfolio of more than 7,000 megawatts and more\n                    than 10,000 megawatts in new power plant\n                    development and construction currently underway.

        "body": "Judging from a number of e-mails I've gotten, this note may not have gotten\nthrough.  So here it comes again.\n\nDiane\n\n************8\n\nHI Everyone,\n\nIt's just about time to think about registering for Fall 01 classes.  Early\nnext week, TJ will be sending materials to your home addresses, and it's\nvery important that you read through them carefully.  In the meantime, I've\nattached a preliminary list of electives that will be offered.\n\nMost importantly, please remember that there are two rounds of\npre-enrollment for Fall 01 classes.  You must enroll in classes during\nRound I to retain your seniority status in classes.  So, for example, if\nyou are going to be a fifth semester student in the fall and forget to sign\nup for classes during Round I, and then try to get into an oversubscribed\nclass in Round II, you will have lost your seniority status because you did\nnot sign up in Round I.\n\nFor those of you who would like to get academic advising (e.g., \"Which\ncourses do I take if I want to be a consumer products marketer?) or program\nplanning (e.g., \"How do graduate in five semesters?\") please feel free to\nmake a telephone or in-person appointment with me.  (Advising by e-mail is\nnearly impossible because of the level detail required for effective\nadvising.)\n\nAs course descriptions become available, they will be put up on the web.\n\nUPDATES ON UNKNOWNS IN THE EvMBA ELECTIVE COURSES\n\nE220, Corporate Financial Reporting, Brett Trueman:  Brett Trueman is the\nAccounting group chair and is a fabulous teacher, winning the Outstanding\nTeacher of the Year Award in the day program.  If you're interested in\nCorporate Finance or Investments, you should take this course eventually.\n\nE234, Corporate Finance, Levy:  Amnon Levy has a PhD from Kellogg, did his\nundergraduate work in economics here at Berkeley, and is visiting next year\nfrom NYU.\n\nE236, Futures and Options, Manuel Ammann:  Prof Ammann is a visitor from\nthe University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.  He visited here last year,\nand I heard he is great.\n\nE259-1, Leadership, Nancy Euske:  Nancy teaches the core course in OB and\nhas done an excellent job.  This will NOT be Jenny Chatman's Leadership\ncourse taught by Nancy Euske.  It will be Nancy's Leadership\ncourse.  Please check the web site for a detailed description.\n\nE264, High-Tech Marketing; Rajiv:  Surendra Rajiv has a PhD from Carnegie\nMellon and will be visiting here next year from the University of\nChicago.  He's taught High Tech Marketing and Pricing Strategies in both\nthe full - and part-time MBA programs at Chicago.\n\nE268, Branding, Upshaw:  Lynn Upshaw is principal of Upshaw & Associates, a\nnational brand and marketing consulting practice.  Mr. Upshaw was formerly\nExecutive Vice President/Brand Marketing for Ketchum Communications\nWorldwide and has written two books \"Building Brand Identity:  A Strategy\nfor Success in a Hostile Marektplace\" and \"The Masterbrand Mandate.\"\n\nE278-1, Deals; Shelanski:  Howard Shelanski is a professor at Boalt, and\nthe basic premise of the course is to tie contract theory, contract law,\nand business strategy together.  \"How do structures of relationships\nbetween firms, or more generally contracting parties, change with contract\nlaw and strategic imperatives?  The course will give students some tools to\nthink about 'business development' from both a legal and economic standpoint.\"\n\nE296-4, E-Business Supply Chain Management, Hamid Noori:  Hamid is a\nProfessor of Technology and Operations Management at the Laurier Business\nSchool, Wilfird Laureir University in Waterloo, Ontario.\n\nE296-5, New Telecom Ventues, Bob Harris:  Bob Harris is a (young) retired\nfaculty member, who went on to establish a very successful consulting\ncompany.  Bob is a great teacher (I had him for Macro), and he is thrilled\nto be back teaching a course on Entrepreneurship in Telecommunications.\n\nE296-6 Pricing Strategy, Scott Davis:  Scott is teaching this course this\nsemester and is doing a great job.  He used to be a faculty member at\nWashington University in St. Louis where he won the Outstanding Teacher of\nthe Year Award, but he moved out here and established a successful\nmarketing consulting practice in the Sacramento area.\n\nCOURSES YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT IN THE DAY PROGRAM:\nBA235 Portfolio Management (Th 2 - 4:00 pm), Jim Wilcox:  Jim teaches our\nE201B class (though he has been serving in Washington DC as Comptroller of\nthe Treasury for the past two years)  and won the Outstanding Teacher of\nthe Year Award in the EvMBA Program just before he left for DC.  This\ncourse will be banking related covering topics such as interest risk and\nmeasuring and controlling credit risk in financial institutions.\n\nBA278 Contemporary Philanthropy (Th 4:00 - 6:00  pm), Fran Van Loo:  Fran\nis a Haas economist who also runs the Public and Not-for-Profit Program.\n\nBA295C Entrepreneurship Workshop (M 2 - 4:00 pm), Danner:  This course is\nfor those students who are actually in the process of \"going live\" with an\nentrepreneurial idea.  Please check the website for details.\n\nBA299D Strategic Marketing Planning (Th 4 - 6:00 pm), Peter Wilton:  Some\noverlap with E210, but definitely a great class taught by a great instructor.\n\n\nSOME GENERAL COMMENTS:\n\n(1)  You should try to take Competitive Strategy as late in your program as\nyou possibly can.  You will get a lot more out of it if you bring to the\ncourse as much previous coursework as possible.  Obviously, you need to\nbalance this against the risk of the course not being offered in subsequent\nsemesters, but it is best to take that course later in your\nprogram.  Currently, Katz is scheduled to teach the course in Spring 02 as\nwell as F01.\n\n(2)  Finance is divided into two main areas:  Corporate Finance and \nInvestments\n- Corporate Finance:  if you are interested in corporate finance you would\nprobably want to take some combination of  E234, E220, E232, E285 (for\ncompanies doing a lot of international/global operations), and perhaps\nE233, and perhaps E222 (Valuation - for large companies involved in a lot\nof acquisitions).\n\n- Investments:  if you're interested in Investments (investment banking,\nfinancial services, etc.), you should probably want to take some\ncombination of  E234, E220 and/or E222 (for individuals going into Mergers\nand Acquisitions), E233 and/or E236, and E285 (if your company is  involved\nin intl markets).\n\n(3)  If you don't want to go into finance but feel like you need a little\nmore finance that just E203, Money Markets (E232) is a great class taught\nby a great instructor.  Please see web for more detail.\n\n(4)  If you are truly interested in concentrating in marketing, the two\n\"core electives\" for marketers are E261, Marketing Research, and E262B,\nProduct Management.  These two courses will  give you the critical basics\nneeded for careers in marketing.  Additionally, Pricing Strategy is an\nimportant course.  The many other marketing classes are more specific to\nparticular industries (e.g., Internet Strategy, High-Tech Marketing, etc.).\n\n(5)  I believe very strongly that EVERYONE should graduate with at least\none OB elective.  In addition to the very popular Negotiations course, we\nhave some other great OB classes:  Org Strategy with Bahrami; Leadership\nwith Chatman or Euske; Power and Politics in Orgs with Schroth in Spring\n02, etc..  When alums are surveyed, they always say \"I wish I took more\nOB!\"  (I know - you've heard me say this a million times!)\n\nIf anything else comes up, I'll keep you posted.\n\nCheers,\n\nDiane \n - F01electives.doc",

For Scandinavia, the only trading office in=\r\n=20\r\nEurope outside of London, I was responsible for both functions, as Local=20\r\nOffice controller, reporting into Barry Pearce, who reported to Fearnley. I=\r\nn=20\r\nJapan I also have this Local Office Controller function, as being responsib=\r\nle=20\r\nfor MO/BO activities in this region. The MO would consist of the trading=20\r\nrelated functions: Documentation (Capture & Confirmation), Risk Management,=\r\n=20\r\nSettlement and Trade Accounting. The BO would consist of G&A's, Salaries &=\r\n=20\r\nWages, Tax, Management reporting, Statutory reporting and VAT.=20\r\n\r\nBack Office:\r\nI report directly to Cassandra Scultz (VP & CAO of Enron APACHI). As much a=\r\ns=20\r\npossible are to be outsourced to our Sydney office (Heidi Mason, who also=\r\n=20\r\nreports to Cassandra), but some work has to be done in Tokyo. The reasons f=\r\nor=20\r\nthis outsourcing decision is enclosed in the Power Point presentation=20\r\nenclosed below.

We are also looking into Oil=\r\n=20\r\ndeals, and have plans for Gas, Coal, Pulp & Paper, Credit and Emissions. Al=\r\nso=20\r\nEBS is on the way.

Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' \nelectricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more \npower pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. \nSources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff \nmembers to accept a so-called structured rate system. \nTop officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the \nstate may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously \nestimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt \nutilities. \nIf so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. \nIn the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' \naverage monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. \nConsumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on \nthe way. \n\"We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money,\" said Larry \nWebster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. \"We might as well admit \nthat electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use \nit, \nlet's pay for it.\" \nSteve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday \nfrom estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he \nsaid, \"were wildly high.\" \n\"The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure, \n\" Maviglio said. \"Until we know the results of the negotiations with the \nutilities, you can't conclude anything.\" \nThe state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and \nSouthern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion \nin debt. \nPG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California \ncan overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the \nDavis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two \ncompanies. \n\"The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall,\" \nsaid John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. \"Either wholesale prices need to come \ndown or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large.\" \nStatewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's \nenergy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in \ndisguise for the governor. \nCOST VS. OUTAGES\nIf given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many \nconsumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. \n\"I don't like either choice,\" said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a \ngooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco \ncandy store. \"But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the \nblackouts.\" \nPublicly, the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay \nwithin \"the existing rate structure\" -- a stealthy way of saying that \nJanuary's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year \nwill remain in place. \nBut privately, he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that \ncould be spread over as long as 10 years, sources said. \nUtility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a \nminimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. \n\"For the good of California, it's inevitable,\" said Gary Ackerman, executive \ndirector of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy industry \nassociation. \nSacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the \nCentral Valley this summer, he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price \nfor power if this keeps the air conditioners on. \n\"It's like gasoline,\" he said. \"I don't like paying higher prices for \ngasoline, but that's the price of doing business.\" \nRatepayers draw the line, though, at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. \n\"If it was 20 percent, I'd probably do it,\" said Tracy resident Mark \nDougherty. \"But if it was more, like 50 percent, I'd rather go with rolling \nblackouts.\" \n\"I'd rather have blackouts,\" agreed Jenny Soghomonian, owner of a shoe- \nrepair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. \"I don't want to pay rates \nthat are so much higher.\" \nNOT EVERY COST PALATABLE\nThis is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find \nthemselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid \nblackouts, they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their \nway. \nYet if rates are not high enough, they may not prevent daily blackout threats \nthis summer and beyond. \n\"Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation,\" said Tom \nHiggins, senior vice president of Edison International, parent company of \nSouthern California Edison. \nSimply put, he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve \npower, and thus alleviate shortages, unless there is a financial incentive to \ndo so. \nRebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response, \nrequiring, critics say, too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. \nBut a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt \nwidespread conservation measures. \n\"It adjusts consumer behavior,\" Higgins said. \"People want to get their bills \nback down.\" \nRATES' EFFECT ON USAGE\nHe and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way \nCalifornians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the \ngovernor -- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. \n\"It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this,\" \nHiggins said. \nConsumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes \nacross loud and clear: No, no, no. \n\"No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals,\" said Harvey Rosenfield, \nhead of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"We \nneed to get back to a regulated system.\" \nRosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened \nto push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market \nif Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. \nBecause of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance \nrebates, which delivered about $800 million to consumers, his threat is taken \nseriously in Sacramento. \n\"We've paid too much already,\" Rosenfield said. \"A fair price is what we were \npromised by deregulation, which was a 20 percent rate decrease.\" \nHowever, when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured \nrate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff, \nRosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. \n\"Big users should pay more,\" he said after a moment's reflection. \"I'm open \nto a tiered system but only if it's fair.\" \nRosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer \nadvocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with \nDavis. \nMOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES\nClearly, though, momentum is building toward a system of structured power \nrates, which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. \nThe California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's \n9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a \nthree-month duration, but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least \nanother three months, if not longer. \nPUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates \ngoing up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. \n\"I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation,\" she said. \"People \nwho use a whole lot of power should pay more.\" \nThe biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself, now that \nCalifornia is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The \nstate already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to \ndetermine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. \nSan Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its \nenergy footing once more, rates will probably be heading up. \"That way, you \nhave more convenience and electricity, more stability,\" she said. \nBut Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate \nincreases and rolling blackouts. \nShe's moving to Texas. \nChronicle staff writers Matthew Stannard and Pia Sarkar contributed to this \nreport. / E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. \n,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

O. Box 26530, Austin, Texas 78755 -\nPhone\n512-795-8536\n\nLonghorns Get Pledge from Euless Trinity Defensive Back\n\nBraden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.4, a defensive back from Euless Trinity who\ncame\nto one of Texas' three-day summer camps earlier this month, committed to\nthe\nLonghorns Wednesday.\nJohnson, a hard-hitting safety who had 42 tackles last season for the 9-2\nTrojans, who had one of the top defenses in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, is\nmoving to quarterback this season.\nHis father, David, told me his son decided to commit to the Longhorns\nbecause\n\"the Texas coaches really impressed him with their coaching methods and\nwith\nthe classy way they operate. They were very open and very straightforward.\"\nDavid Johnson said his son also attended a TCU camp this summer and went to\na\nTexas A&M camp last summer. He said several schools called his son in May,\nthe month the NCAA allows schools to make one phone call to each recruit.\nHe\nsaid calls came from coaches at Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arkansas,\nTCU\nand others, but he said his son decided to commit to Texas and get the\nrecruiting process behind him so he could concentrate on his senior season.\nBraden Johnson has strong athletic blood lines. David Johnson was on a\nfootball scholarship at Oklahoma State when he suffered a career-ending\nshoulder injury and David has two famous uncles for old-time football fans.\nOne is Bill Johnson, who had a 20-year career as a player and coach with\nthe\nSan Francisco 49ers and who also coached with Paul Brown on the Cleveland\nBrowns' staff. The other is Gil Johnson, the quarterback on the great SMU\nteams that featured Doak Walker and Kyle Rote.\nBraden Johnson is a three-sport star. He plays centerfield in baseball and\nruns on the 400-meter relay in track. He also is a good student.\nJohnson is the fifth high school star to commit to Texas this month. The\nothers are WR-DB Brian Carter of The Woodlands, and OLs Jonathan Scott of\nDallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village and Will Allen of\nHouston Cypress Falls. In addition, Alfio Randall, a super OL recruit a\nyear\nago, is on track to graduate from Blinn JC in December and he told me he\nwill\nenroll at Texas in January.\nAll five of the high school prospects who committed did so after attending\none of the Longhorns' summer camps.\nScott and Robinson are on virtually all of the national top 100 lists.\nRECRUITING NOTES: The top running back and the top quarterback  in Texas\nboth\nsay they would like to commit early and the Longhorns are in strong\ncontention for both. The RB is Cedric Benson of Midland Lee, who rushed for\n3,526 yards and 51 touchdowns in leading Lee to a 16-0 season and it's\nsecond\nstraight Class 5A state championships. Both those incredible totals are\nClass\n5A records. The QB is Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch, who threw for\n2,500 yards as a sophomore before suffering a broken collarbone last season\nthat knocked him out of his teams' final five games. He still passed for\n1,170 yards. . . The Longhorns already have commitments from two of the 24\nmembers of the \"Super Team\" in Dave Campbell's Texas Football Magazine.\nThey\nare Scott and Robinson. The only other member of the \"Super Team\" who has\ncommitted is Madisonville RB David Underwood, the Aggies' No. 1 RB target\nwho\nannounced last week that he is going to be a Michigan Wolverine. Allen made\nthe second team and Carter made the third team. . . There are at least five\nsuper players I have seen who will be big recruiting targets next year.\nThat's right ? they were so good as sophomores that every school in the\ncountry already knows about them. They are QB Vincent Young, 6-5, 195, 4.5,\nof Houston Madison; RB Selvin Young, 5-11, 188, 4.4, of Houston Jersey\nVillage; DL Marco Martin, 6-4, 290, 4.7, of Mesquite; DE Travis Leitko,\n6-5,\n250, 4.7, of The Woodlands, and TE-OL Eric Winston, 6-6, 265, 5.0, of\nMidland\nLee. Young ran for 2,204 yards last year in a tough district. Young threw\nfor\n1,007 yards and ran for 730 more as a sophomore, also in a tough league.\nMartin is so agile that he also plays fullback and so quick that he's a\nterrific pass rusher and run stopper. Leitko was a dominating force as a\nsophomore last year on The Woodlands' playoff team. Winston is a great\nathlete who was one of the stars on Lee's title team as a sophomore. Leitko\nand Young came to Texas' summer camp earlier this month.\nIn the \"did-you-know\" department: Nebraska was 81-8 in the last seven\nfootball seasons. That makes the Huskers 80-5 against the rest of the world\nduring that span, but only 1-3 against our Longhorns.\n* * * *\nMy next fax will be whenever events warrant.\n* * * *\nThe True Orange Fax Service includes  at  least  99 faxes  a year and costs\n$99 ($79 by E-Mail).

I'm aggressive and I'm really strong,\" said Harris,\nwho bench presses 405 pounds. \"I'm just blessed. That's all I can really\nsay.\" College coaches agree. Said one recruiting coordinator, \"When you are\nthinking about the best defensive linemen in the state of Texas, just draw\na\nline under Tommie Harris. He is clearly the best defensive lineman in the\nstate. He is the only great one.\"\n\nLast season, this 57-foot shot-putter had 139 tackles, including 21 for\nlosses and eight sacks. Tommie, whose father is in the Army, was born in\nGermany but has lived in the United States since 1991.\n\nHe strongly favors TEXAS, which is 45 minutes from his home. \"Mack Brown is\ngonna do some good there. They are a team on the rise. I feel at home there\nand there is no school with better facilities. They have a great weight\nprogram. There is a 75 percent chance I'll choose TEXAS.\"\n\nOthers in the running are MIAMI (\"I like their attack defense. I always\nliked Warren Sapp. He's great. I don't know much about them, but my family\nis from Pompano Beach and I still have family there.\"), TEXAS A&M, FLORIDA\nSTATE (\"When I was a kid, I always used to watch them.

        "body": "Here's what I have:  I'm sure I'm on time in some time zone somewhere.  Tim \nBelden is due back from vacation on Monday.  The West desk would not give me \nany valuation estimates until Tim returned.\n\nEES\n\nPTR, Phase I  \nEnron was the only party that raised the issue of the UDCs imposing an \nartificial cap on the PX credit for direct customers (RAP '98).  The CPUC \nshined us on. Later, we ensured that it became part of ARM's case in PTR \nPhase I. The way the \"cap\" worked, the UDCs would not pay ESPs the full PX \ncredit when prices were high -- they would pay a credit that, when added to \nthe other bill components, did not exceed the frozen rate for the direct \naccess customer, thereby costing ESPs potentially a lot of  money.  It was \nclear in the previous CPUC direct access decisions that UDCs had no right to \ncap direct access credits. Because of our good case and the fact that the \nUDCs believed the chance of such high PX prices was LOW, the UDCs settled \nwith ARM on this issue in 1999.\n\n2000 NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides: $30 - 40 million\n% Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 90%\n\nGreen Credit Legislation\nEnron and other green suppliers began work in 1998 to extend the credit given \nfor sales of green power. The credit was scheduled to end by 2002. In 1999, \nthe money specified in AB 1890 was being depleted rapidly and Green Mountain \ntook the lead in pressing for legislation. We actively supported Green \nMountain by lobbying legislators and other interest groups, working with \nenvrionmental organizations, and spearheading legislative amendments.  \nAlthough this bill became wrapped up in the San Diego crisis and ISO/PX \nissues, the green credit portion of the bill remained intact.  We had also \ndecided jointly to propose a ten-year credit and were very pleased and \nsurprised that it survived into the final bill.  Governor Davis is expected \nto sign the bill. \n\n2000 NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides: $50 million\n% Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 25%\n\nRAP '99\nEnron, through ARM, has successfully made its case that retail procurement \nand retail sales costs should be removed from the Distribution Charge that \nall customers pay.  Direct Access customers would receive a credit on their \nbills in addition to the PX credit. Enron was the first party to raise these \nissues as part of RAP '98 and got a Commission decision in that case to \ndetermine the credit in RAP '99.  In RAP '99, Enron chose to use ARM to \nlitigate the case as a cheaper alternative.  Hearings were completed in the \nSpring of 2000.  ARM has negotiated settlement rates with certain parties and \nhas convinced the Assigned Commissioner to draft his own decision to \ncounteract the unfavorable ALJ decision. An additional credit of from $0.25 \nto $0.30/MWh is expected.  The decision will be voted out within the next two \nmonths.\n\n2000 NPV estimted by Dennis Benevides: $1 - 5 million\n% Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 75%\n\nECT\n\nFTR Release April 1, 2000\nI have spearheaded the release of firm transmission rights in CA since I \njoined the Company in 11/96.  Our long and painful fight with creeping \nnodalism culminated with the release of some, but not all, FTRs in April of \nthis year.  ENA actively participated in the auction and became the largest \nsingle purchaser of FTRs.  The new congestion management approach, which \nEnron also spearheaded, will require 100% release of FTRs, but will not take \neffect until next year. This valuation looks only at the FTR release in 2000.\n\n2000 NPV estimated by Tim Belden: To be determined 9/17/00\n% Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 90%\n\n\nISO Price Caps\nENA was long in the market in the West and had millions at risk when lower \nprice caps began to be discussed in CA in mid June.  Government Affairs, \nworking with Dave Parquet and others, was instrumental in significantly \ndelaying the movement to lower price caps, thereby giving ENA time to move \nout of those positions.  The following events happened in 2000.  We entered \nthe year with a price cap of $750, having fought to raise it to that level in \n1999.  In March 2000, the ISO considered lowering the price cap to $500 but \nvoted to leave it at $500, because they believed at the time that market \npower had been adequately mitigated.  After the four very high-priced days in \nJune, the ISO considered lowering the price cap to $250 with a vote on June \n22, but the vote failed by ONE VOTE. Instead, the Board lowered the price cap \nto $500.  The Board voted again on July 1 to lower the cap and again the vote \nfailed by ONE VOTE.  Finally, on August 1, the Board approved the $250 price \ncap, effective August 7.  In June, Government Affairs intitiated an all-out \nlobbying effort to convince Board members and their constituents to oppose \nlower price caps.  We also lobbied interest groups, banks, venture \ncapitalists, NYMEX and others to weigh in on this issue with individual Board \nMembers and the Board itself, going so far as to set up a special arrangement \nwith the ISO staff to allow interested parties to address the Board \ntelephonically. \n\n2000 NPV estimated by Tim Belden: To be determined 9/17/00\n% Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 80%\n\n\nNew Market-Oriented Board Member\nThe ISO recently held Board elections for the first time.  Government Affairs \nactively sought market-oriented individuals to run for the Board and replace \nthose that do not support competitive markets.  Enron was successful in \ngetting about five to run.  The Members selected or confrmed by the EOB have \nbeen held up and we do not yet know the outcome of those Board seats.  \nHowever, one seat of interest has been decided.  Dave Parquet suggested a \npotential municipal representative who was extremely market-oriented (Michael \nWood, City Attorney for the City of Pittsburgh).  Government Affairs worked \nwith him closely to decide which seat to run for, help him prepare his \napplication, suggest lobbying tactics, assist in lobbying and support him \nwith other Board Members.  He won the election and became a Board Member in \nearly September.  This effort is significant, because the munis voted nearly \n100% in support of lower price caps. The position he took was one of those \nvotes.  All other things being equal, we have now added a vote on our side \nthat could be instrumental in defeating further efforts to impose lower or \nadditional price caps, given the close votes that have taken place thus far.\n\n2000 NPV estimated based on Tim Belden's Pice Cap Assessment: To be \ndetermined 9/17/00\n% Attibuted to Enron's Efforts: 100%\n\n",

O. Box 26530, Austin, Texas 78755 -\nPhone\n512-795-8536\n\nBrown Says Offense Much Improved, Defense Very Solid\n\nCoach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorns' offense should be much better\nthis season, and he said the defense should be his best since coming to\nTexas.\nBrown said the players showed up in great shape and have shown a lot of\nenthusiasm in all of the early practices. He also said thd depth,\noffensively\nand defensively, will be better than it has been.\nThe offensive line is the main question mark, and Brown said flatly, \"The\noffensive line is much improved. There is a lot more cohesiveness. Most of\nthe guys were starting for the first time last year and they are much more\nsure of what they need to do now that they have more experience.\"\nHe said guard Antwan Kirk-Hughes is the most improved offensive linemen,\nbut\nhe also said, \"We feel like all five (offensive line starters) will be\nquality\nplayers.\"\nThe team appears to be thinner at guard than tackle on offense, but the\ncoaches have moved backup tackle Robbie Doane to guard. That is a sure sign\nthat they like the work of massive true freshman Lionel Garr at offensive\ntackle. They want to have four tackles and four guards. With Leonard Davis\nand Mike Williams starting at tackle and Cory Quye and Garr backing them up\nand Kirk-Hughes and Derrick Dockery starting at guard and Doane and Tillman\nHolloway backing them up, they get their desired two-deep. Broad also said\njunior squadman Corey Bradford has been looking good at tackle. At center,\nstarter Matt Anderson is getting a strong challenge from Beau Baker.\nBrown also has said a lot of true freshmen will play this year. \"If we\nthink\nthey can help us win, they'll play,\" he said following a two-hour practice\nsession Sunday Morning. True freshman WR Roy Williams and redshirt freshman\nWR Artie Ellis, both in the 6-3, 6-4 range, had outstanding practices.\nLooking at the 21 freshmen, it appears likely that 14 will play. They are\nGarr, WRs Roy Williams, B. J. Johnson, Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery, TE\nBrock Edwards, DEs Adam Doiron and Kalen Thonton, DT Stevie Lee, CB Nathan\nVasher, LB Austin Sendlein, safety Phillip Geiggar, punter Justin Smith and\nkicker Matt McFadden.  Brown has said he wants to use the two kickers, at\nleast in back-up roles, so they will have a little experience when they\ntake\nover the two jobs next year.\nTE Bo Scaife's season-ending knee injury has the coaches putting Edwards on\nthe fast track to get him ready to play quickly. TE coach Tim Brewster says\nEdwards is picking up things very quickly. Brown said, \"The thing  that Bo\ngave us was great speed down the field. Brock Edwards looks pretty fast,\ntoo,\nand he's ahead of where Bo was last year because of Bo's knee.\" Scaife came\nto Texas after undergoing surgery on his other knee.\nThe true freshmen who probably won't play, barring a rash of injuries at\ntheir positions, are QB Chance Mock, RB Sneezy Beltran, FB Will Matthews,\nOLs\nTrey Bates and Jason Glynn,  and LBs Austin Sendlein and Rashad Thomas.\nMock,\nas the third quarterback behind Chris Simms and Major Applewhite, will be\ntrained to be ready to play, but Brown said he hopes to redshirt him. He\nhas\nbeen looking very good. Beltran and Matthews also look good, but the Horns\nare deep at their positions. Brown also has said he hopes to redshirt some\noffensive linemen, and Bates and Glynn are the likely candidates.\n* * * *\nCorrection: Oh boy, when I mess up, I mess up. In last night's fax, I\nquoted\na Texas coach as comparing Roy Williams favorably with Lovell Pinkney and\nMike Williams. Obviously, I meant Lovell Pinkney and Mike Adams. Sorry\nabout\nthat. Got my Mike's mixed up.\n* * * *\nRECRUITING NOTES: Texas continues to lead for the state's best DT, Tommie\nHarris of Killeen Ellison; best LB Derrick Johnson of Waco; best safety,\nDewayne Brandon of Temple; best RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee; best QB\nMatt\nNordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch, and best TE, James Moses of Galena Park\nNorth Shore, , , The high school football season starts next week, and, for\nthe first time in several years, I will be able to scout five of the\nstate's\ntop players without driving very far. They are Harris, Johnson, Brandon, CB\nCedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes (a UT commitment) and QB/Athlete Quan\nCosby of Mart.\n* * * *\nMy next fax will be Monday, August 21.\n* * * *\nThe True Orange Fax Service includes  at  least  99 faxes  a year and costs\n$99 ($79 by E-Mail).

We have helped them to find out which German \njournalists the German gas incumbent, Ruhrgas, has sent to California this \nweek.  We found out about that yesterday.  I have now passed on that list + \nsome general PR recommendations and EFET will now take the lead on this (they \nwill send out an EFET position paper on California and have a spokesperson \navailable especially for California - he's not Enron!).\n\nJust wanted to make sure you are aware because it could be possible that \npeople will come to us for further comment.  The general consensus now is \nthat we then refer them to EFET.\n\nThanks\nEva\n---------------------- Forwarded by Eva Hoeffelman/LON/ECT on 03/23/2001 \n12:37 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nEva Hoeffelman\n03/23/2001 12:35 PM\nTo: secretariat@efet.org, ingrid@efet.org, Jackie Gentle/LON/ECT@ECT, Peter \nStyles/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul Hennemeyer/LON/ECT@ECT, \nDavid Gallagher/LON/ECT@ECT, Andreas Radmacher/FRA/ECT@ECT, Eric \nShaw/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Helge-J_rgen Beil/FRA/ECT@ECT, Carsten Haack/FRA/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: journalists in California sent by Ruhrgas\n\nJan,\n\nPlease  see below a summary of the journalists who will be returning this \nweekend from their trip to California courtesy of Ruhrgas. \n\nUp to you now to send them the EFET position paper on California.  Would \nsuggest you try to get it on their desk by Monday morning latest, if \npossible.  Would also send it to those who have refused to go and other key \ncontacts we have given to you.

Obviously, we will divert any \nrequests we get to you. Will get their email addresses to you later so you \ncan email it to them rather than fax it with the possibility they will get it \ntoo late. \n\nGood luck.\n\nGroet\nEva\n---------------------- Forwarded by Eva Hoeffelman/LON/ECT on 03/23/2001 \n12:15 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nChristina_Mueller@de.cohnwolfe.com on 03/23/2001 12:09:08 PM\nTo: eva.hoeffelman@enron.com\ncc:  \n\nSubject: journalists in California\n\n\nEva,\n\nI've finished my guerilla-PR-job, here are the results:\n\nRuhrgas has invited the Nordrhein-Westfalen (region where Essen is located)\n-based correspondents of the national dailies and also the energy\njournalists of the most important business magazines.\n\nJournalists in Califonia:\n-Werner Sturbeck (FAZ - Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung)\n-Werner Jaspert (S_ddeutsche Zeitung)\n-Dr. J_rgen Frech (WAZ - Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung\n-Jochen Schuster (Focus)\n\nJournalists that had been invited but refused:\n-Dr. Andreas Wildhagen (Wirtschaftswoche)\n-Hans-Willy Bein (Financial Times Deutschland)\n-Die Welt\n\nI also got the information that Ruhrgas held a press conference yesterday\nin California.

I also will do an additional internet monitoring (for\nexample WAZ, which we don't read daily) this afternoon to see if there are\nalready some articles.\n\nWe should recommend EFET to send their statement not only to those\njournalists who have been on the press trip but to all key contacts.

Please keep in mind this is a \ntentative draft.

The systemic problems that created a large \nvolume of the discrepancies in our previous testing have been greatly \nreduced.  The majority of the discrepancies identified in the most recent \ntesting are primarily a result of random data entry errors and some deal \nbooking changes made in the back office without the Product Control Group's \nknowledge.  Torrey has already corrected the most significant discrepancies \nand is continuing to investigate the smaller items.  \n\nAndrew and I will both be on vacation for the week of August 28.  When we \nreturn, we will set up a meeting with you and Dave to discuss the final \nresults once Torrey has had time to conclude his research.\n\n\n\nSteve\n\n\n\n",

O. Box 26530, Austin, Texas 78755\nPhone 512-795-8536\n\nScaife Injures Knee, Out for Season; Roy Williams Tears Up Varsity DBs\n\nSophomore TE Bo Scaife, the guy I figured the offense could least afford to\nlose because of his blitz-breaking capabilities, tore the ACL in his left\nknee during the Longhorns' first varsity workout Friday morning and he will\nbe out for the season.\nScaife, a sure-handed tight end with great speed, had surgery on his right\nknee as a senior in high school. He was slowed by that injury last season,\nbut regained his speed by the spring and was sensational in spring drills.\nCoach Mack Brown said Scaife will undergo surgery and will miss the entire\nseason. The only good news is that he can use this season as a redshirt\nseason, since he did play some last season. That means he will have three\nyears of eligibility remaining, beginning in 2001.\n\"Now, he will have had them both fixed, they'll be stronger and maybe he\ncan\nhave three good years,\" Brown said.\nBrown said Mike Jones, the starter last season at tight end, is a\nsure-handed\nreceiver and outstanding blockers, but he said the Horns will miss Scaife's\nspeed. He said freshman Brock Edwards, who also has speed, but not as much\nas\nScaife, will get a lot of work, starting Saturday, to see if he can help\ntake\nup some of the slack left by Scaife's injury. He also said walk-on TE\nCullen\nLoeffler has shown some good things and also will get a chance to see if he\ncan contribute.\nThis was a major blow to the Texas offense, but there is some good news.\nThe\nLonghorns probably have their best secondary since 1991, but freshman WR\nRoy\nWilliams, 6-3, 208, long-armed and fast, fast, fast, treated the starting\ncornerbacks and safeties like cannon fodder in the morning workout,\ncatching\ntwo long touchdown passes and tight-roping the sideline for two other big\ncatches. He dropped only one pass all day, and it was when he ran over an\nobstacle. The team worked primarily on putting in some running plays in the\nafternoon workout, so the DBs were spared another dose of Williams in the\nafternoon.\nAll of the heralded freshmen WRs are looking good, but Williams is looking\nsensational. I can see why some veteran West Texas football watchers say he\nis the greatest prospect ever to come out of Odessa Permian. There just\naren't a lot of people his size who can run 100 meters in 10.03, high jump\nseven feet and broad jump a state record 26-5.\nEven defensive coordinator Carl Reese was impressed by Williams. \"I tell\nyou\nwhat, he didn't look like a freshman to me,\" Reese said. \"He looked pretty\ngood out there.\"\nSloan Thomas, B. J. Johnson and Tony Jeffery are the other three freshmen\nWRs, and they all had their moments Friday. Thomas made some acrobatic\ncatches on balls that appeared to be overthrown, Johnson and Jeffery, a\nhigh\nschool QB star who is making the switch to WR, both used their quickness to\nget off the line of scrimmage and make some impressive grabs.\nThe Longhorns are loaded at QB, with All-Big 12 Major Applewhite battling\nbudding star Chris Simms for the starting job. Both looked very sharp\nthrowing\nlong and short Friday, but freshman CB Nathan Vasher and backup linebacker\nO. J. McClintock picked off two of Simms' passes and both might have scored\nif it had been in a game-type scrimmage.\nApplewhite, who underwent off-season knee surgery, appeared to be back to\nnormal. He showed as much mobility as he has ever had in rolling right or\nleft, and his passes were on target. Simms also had a good day, except for\nthe two interceptions.\n* * * *\nRECRUITING NOTES:  Don't be surprised if the official visit for DE Eric\nHall\nof Clarksville, Tenn., is moved from the scheduled Sept. 9 date. Hall has a\ngame Friday night, Sept. 8, and UT's game on Saturday, Sept. 9, starts at\n11:30 a.m. UT can have a jet plane waiting for Hall after his game and it\ncan\nfly him to Austin, but his parents want to come on his visit to Austin,\ntoo.\nBut NCAA rues don't allow schools to transport parents. So, the parents\nwould\nhave to fly commercially, which means they would either have to leave\nbefore\nhis high school game that Friday, or come in Saturday, in which case they\nwould be too late for the Texas' season opener against Louisiana-\nLafayette.\n. . The early emphasis in Texas recruiting has been on offensive linemen.\nLook for the late emphasis to be on signing five or six defensive linemen,\nincluding some big ends who might grow into tackles.\n* * * *\nThe True Orange Fax Service includes  at  least  99 faxes  a year and costs\n$99 ($79 by E-Mail).

Volumes won't take \noff without well-designed, permanent rules, they said.\nEven then Europe's second-largest electricity market may never become much of \na trading hub because of the dominance of state utility Electricity de France \n(F.EDF) which, with its huge installed nuclear capacity, is already among \nEurope's cheapest electricity suppliers. \n\"There's so much missing,\" said Katrin Durwald, an energy analyst with HEW \nEnergy Trading, talking about RTE's tariffs and rules.\"Nothing is really \nclear in France,\" she said. \nTraders are especially upset over RTE's congestion costs, which only new \nmarket entrants share and which can add as much as 50% to the price of \nelectricity. \nOther traders say access charges to the medium- to low-voltage network are \nimpossible to figure out. But permanent tariffs won't go into effect until \nJuly 1 at the earliest, French electricity regulator CRE says. \nPermanent grid rules won't reach the regulator's desk for review until early \nsummer, reckons RTE President Andre Merlin. \nEven with clearer regulation, the dominance of EDF will hold back the market. \nFormer monopoly supplier EDF is a formidable competitor, a predominantly \nnuclear power producer with some of the lowest electricity prices in Europe. \nTraders estimate between 20 and 50 trades are going through monthly in \nFrance, mostly for electricity delivered the next day or next week. \nThat's a far cry from neighboring Germany before the launch of spot \nelectricity exchanges there, when 160 short-term transactions were struck \ndaily, HEW Energy Trading estimates. \nMore immediately, what's missing in France is a steady stream of one-year \nsupply deals, a sign that foreign power companies are regularly furnishing \nelectricity to French industrial consumers. \n\"I seriously doubt whether there are companies taking risk and supplying \ncustomers,\" a trader with a large European power company said. \nFrench high-voltage grid operator RTE said 325 grid access contracts were \nsigned this year for all transactions, as of March 12, equilavent to an \naverage of four of five deals a day. \nThere are, nonetheless, some pockets of activity in France. \nTraders are exchanging blocks of electricity to help industrial consumers \ncurb costly imbalance charges, by grouping the companies' electricity needs \nto even out consumption patterns. \nRTE says 21 companies are authorized to furnish or buy back imbalance \nelectricity. \nSwiss hydro producers are also exporting spot electricity to France, analysts \nsaid, notably Elektrizitaetsgesellschaft Laufenburg AG (Z.EGL) and \nAare-Tessin AG fuer Elektrizitaet (Z.AAR). \n\"Germany and France are the biggest export countries for Swiss spot hydro,\" \nDurwald said. \nAt the same time, two Dutch energy distributors, NUON NV (N.NUN) and REMU NV, \nhave been active in France, traders said. \nNUON purchased a few small hydroelectric producers, which are bound under an \neight-year contract to sell electricity exclusively to EDF. \nBut NUON can sell electricity to new customers above the contract price EDF \nis obliged to pay under its single buyer obligation, Durwald said. \nSome traders see opportunities cropping up this year from changes to the way \ntransport capacity is allocated on France's interconnectors with the U.K. and \nwith Italy. \n\"Cogenerators (gas-fired power plants) in France with surplus capacity could \nsell to traders in Germany looking to import electricity into Italy,\" a \ntrader at a large pan-European trading organization said. \nRTE forbids electricity ordered and delivered on the same day sourced from \nGermany and Switzerland to be imported to Italy. \nThat trader also expects the daily transfer capacity auction on the \nU.K.-France Interconnector, which starts March 31, to spark more electricity \ntrading in both countries. \n\"The day-ahead risk is rather limited, not only in France but also in the \nU.K.,\" he said. \nThe following are traders and power companies said to be active in France, in \naddition to those concerns already mentioned in the article, according to a \nDow Jones Newswires survey: Belgium's Electrabel SA(B.ELE) \nSpain's Grupo Endesa SA(E.EDS) \nTXU Europe Energy Trading(TXU) \nFrench independent producer SNET \nEnron Europe Ltd.(U.ENE) \nTotalFinaElf(TOT) \nDynegy Europe Ltd.(DYN) \nElectricite de Laufenbourg SA \nRWE Trading AG(G.RWE) \nE.On AG(G.EOA) \nElectricite de France(F.EDF) \nHEW Energy Trading AG \n\nWeb site: http://www.rtefrance.com \n-By Sarah Wachter, Dow Jones Newswires; 33-1-4017-1740; \nsarah.wachter@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

THE Government is awaiting the opinion of the Law \nMinistry on the claim of the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) for the bill of Rs \n102 crore under the counter-guarantee cover, for the 740-MW Dabhol power \nproject, before deciding on making the next payment to the utility. \nThe Union Government has sought the opinion of the Law Ministry, as the \nMaharashtra Government had written to it, suggesting that the claim should \nnot be honoured, as the DPC had not complied with load despatch instructions.\nThe Law Ministry's views are crucial to any decision on going in later for \nfuture course of action which could be either arbitration or High Court \nproceedings. \nThe Government has sought an early response from the Law Ministry as the \n15-day interest free period for payment of DPCs's contentious bill for the \nmonth of December 2000 ends on Friday. \nAccording to the counter guarantee agreement, the Government will have to pay \nwith interest (at Bank rate) the outstandings, if it is paid after 15 days of \nthe receipt of the notice to the Government of India. \nThe Government has one month's time from the date of presentation of the \nclaim by the company to meet its obligations. \nLast time, the Maharashtra Government managed to make a payment to the MSEB \nin the nick of time, after DPC invoked the guarantee. \nThis time the cause for conflict is the counter claim put forth by the \nMaharashtra Government seeking a rebate of Rs 400 crore from the power \nproject sponsors. \nThe conflict hinges on a technical issue involving legal interpretation of \nthe Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between the Maharashtra State Electricity \nBoard and project developers led by Enron. \nMSEB's contention is that the PPA requires Enron to make available power \ncorresponding to 90 per cent 'Plant Availability' within a period of three \nhours of the requisition. \nOn a particular day in January, Dabhol took five hours to achieve this task, \naccording to the MSEB. Hence, MSEB has sought rebate as penalty for non \ncompliance of despatch instructions. \nDPC, meanwhile, has contended that the despatch instructions were not in the \nformat prescribed in the PPA. \nOur Bureau\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

THE Japanese Ambassador in India, Mr Hiroshi Hirabayashi, \ntoday complained that there were \"numerous instances\" of foreign companies \nestablished in India, being harassed by tax officials. \nDelivering a speech at the Indo-Japan Centre here, Mr Hirabayashi that the \ntax collectors \"seem to view foreign companies as an easy prey from whom they \ncould collect as much as possible without being bothered by political \npressure.\"\nOut \"of frustration and decreased chance of making profit, not a few Japanese \ncompanies have closed their businesses.\" \nMr Hirabayashi said he had taken up the matter with the Finance Minister, Mr \nYashwant Sinha, and had given the message that \"tax officers are indeed \nkilling the goose that lay golden eggs.\" \nIn a particularly blunt speech, Mr Hirabayashi said one of the reasons why \nJapanese companies are hesitant to invest in India is because \"what they hear \nis mostly sob-stories, stories of hardships faced by foreign investors.\" \nForeign companies are carefully watching the development of Enron and \nSuzuki-Maruti ventures, for instance, he said. \nJapanese companies found East and South-East Asian countries more \ninvestor-friendly and preferred to invest there. \nThe Ambassador cited two more reasons for poor Japanese investments in India: \npoor infrastructure and red- tapism. \"While the single window system for \nforeign investment is set up, yet, when a foreign investor actually \nestablishes a new venture, he has to use much nerve and money in obtaining \nplethora of clearances and permissions.\" \nMr Hirabayashi was also critical of the investment climate in Maharashtra, \nwhere \"foreign companies are constantly hammered by unlawful elements.\" \nOn the other hand, he spoke warmly of Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra \nPradesh, mentioning the names of the Chief Ministers by name. \nHe said that he found in their attitude \"perceptible changes for the better.\" \nOur Bureau\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Patil told the Assembly on Thursday. \nReplying to the debate on the power tariff hike, Patil said: ``As soon as \ngeneration is started at Tannir Bhavi, the PPA will go to the KERC. All PPAs \nhave to be cleared by the KERC before implementation.''\nEarlier, A. Ramdas (BJP) alleged that the Karnataka Power Transmission \nCorporation (KPTC) had to pay a steep Rs 5.63 per unit for Tannir Bhavi power \nas per the terms of the PPA. \n``Even if we don't buy the power, we have to pay Rs 650 crore, in dollars, \nabsorbing the differences in the price of naphta, as per the PPA. What is the \ngovernment's vested interest in this project?'' he asked. \nPatil said the PPA, which includes escrow cover, had to be honoured following \na direction from the Karnataka High Court. ``We are facing power shortage, \nspecially at the height of summer, and are buying power from wherever \npossible. The KPTC Chairman and I are going to Delhi to see if we can get \nmore power from the central grid,'' he added. \nMaharashtra had offered power at Rs 3.90 per unit from Enron. ``It is \nexpensive, but if we have no alternative, we will buy power from them,'' he \nindicated. \nReferring to the bribery case in the 220 KV Kadra project, he seven of the \neight accused had been arrested. ``Director (Distribution) Vijaybhaskar, \nhowever, has taken anticipatory bail,'' he added. \nResponding to Araga Jnanendra's (BJP) allegation that the government had \nhanded over the Mavalagi project across Kali river to a independent power \nproducer instead of the profit-making and government-owned Karnataka Power \nCorporation (KPC), Patil said: ``The KPC has taken a policy decision not to \ngo for projects below 250 MW.'' \nThe minister ruled out subsidies to sectors other than agriculture, for which \nthe government has agreed to release Rs 144 crore to KPTC. ``There are review \npetitions from other sectors before the KERC, which will decide. But the \ngovernment is not in a position to give any more money,'' he maintained.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Bryson Hull\n\n03/22/2001\nReuters English News Service\n(C) Reuters Limited 2001.\n\nHOUSTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Improving power transmission capacity is the \nbiggest challenge Texas faces heading into deregulation next year, the \nmanager of the state's power grid said on Thursday. \nCalifornia's Achilles' heel, a lack of generating capacity, is not Texas' \nproblem, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) chief executive \nofficer Tom Noel said.\n\"Capacity is not the only issue. Serving this 200,000 square miles of \nterritory and 6 million customers requires an awful lot of transmission, \ndistribution and wire,\" Noel said in a speech at the Houston Energy Expo. \n\"Also important are the constraints that exist.\" \nCurrently, has 65,000 MW of generation and a 2000 peak summer load of around \n57,000 MW. Twenty-two new power plants have been built in Texas in the past \nfive years, 15 are under construction and 30 are on the drawing board, he \nsaid. \nMoving that power from often remote plants to the biggest markets presents a \nchallenge, particularly in four areas served by ERCOT, which manages 85 \npercent of the Texas power grid. \n\"You can't get it from there to here,\" Noel said of the trouble spots. \nTransmission constraints exist in moving power from the south to the north, \nwhere fast-growing Dallas creates a high demand; inside Dallas itself; from \nthe Rio Grande Valley to Austin and San Antonio in Central Texas; and from \nlightly populated West Texas to the eastern half of the state. \nIn the last case, several companies including Enron Corp. have committed to \nbuilding wind power facilities out on the western plains, to supply power to \nthe more densely populated eastern half of Texas. \nINCENTIVES TO BUILD TRANSMISSION \nThough companies have already anted up to erect power lines in the problem \nareas, the state will have to provide attractive rates of return to encourage \ncontinuing infrastructure investments, he said. \n\"The rate of return is going to have to be a little higher than it was in the \npast,\" Noel said. \nHe expected that the Texas Public Utility Commission, which negotiates such \nrates with the utilities, would look to a range of 10-12 percent return on \ninvestment, as opposed to current rates in the neighborhood of eight percent. \nTransmission is the only major part of the state's electricity market which \nwill still be regulated after retail deregulation kicks off, he said. The \nwholesale market has been deregulated since 1995. \n\"We believe the infrastructure has to be regulated,\" Noel said. \n\"Part of our plan is to make sure that someone who owns the wires cannot \nbecome a market player and cut out people who have power to sell and can't \nget to market because they can't get to the lines,\" he said. \nUnder the Texas deregulation plan, generators will sell power directly to \ncustomers but will send it via wires likely owned by other companies. That is \npart of the reason traditional regulated Texas utilities like TXU Corp. and \nReliant Energy Inc. are splitting their regulated and unregulated businesses \ninto separate entities. \nNoel said ERCOT and the state government are both committed to starting \nderegulation on schedule on Jan. 1, 2002. The first active move toward that \nend comes on April 2, when ERCOT will conduct a mock market. \nNoel acknowledged \"it's not going to be pretty,\" because of some delays in \nsetting up the computer hardware and software needed to undertake the testing \nprior to the start date. A pilot program for 5 percent of retail customers is \nnext up on June 1.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

However, some \nsuppliers have been reluctant to keep doing business with the nearly-bankrupt \nutilities. \nCalifornia's utilities have racked up billions in debts from skyrocketing \nelectricity costs that the firms are prohibited from passing on to consumers \nunder the state's deregulation law. \nLike President Bush, many of the energy firms oppose a price cap on wholesale \nelectricity prices in the West as proposed by California Governor Gray Davis \nand other governors in the region. Bush fears a price cap would discourage \nenergy firms from building new power plants. \n\"A TOUGH-LUCK APPROACH\" \n\"We have an administration that has failed to come forward with a policy...to \nput in place an energy price cap immediately to begin to solve this problem,\" \nMurray said. \"Unfortunately, this administration has advocated a tough-luck \napproach.\" \nMurray is co-sponsoring a Democratic energy bill unveiled on Thursday that \nincludes language to limit the prices generating companies can charge for \nwholesale power in 11 western states. \nThe White House defended the administration's policy against price curbs for \nelectricity. \"The reason why we oppose price caps is because they don't work, \nthey would make the problem worse by driving away supply and failing to \npromote (energy) conservation,\" White House deputy press secretary Claire \nBuchan said on Thursday. \nDespite Murray's accusations of neglect by the president, Buchan said the \nadministration cares how the energy crisis is affecting consumers in the \nWest. \n\"The president is very sympathetic to the concerns and anxiety of individuals \nin western states as they view the mounting energy issues in that area,\" she \nsaid. \nBush and Vice President Dick Cheney were plagued with accusations during last \nyear's campaign of being too cozy with big oil firms. \nThe oil industry gave millions of dollars to Bush's presidential campaign and \nother Republican races throughout the country last year. \nBush also depended on advice from executives of several energy firms, \nincluding natural gas giant Enron Corp. , in developing an energy policy for \nhis new administration. \nBush, a former Texas oilman, has named Vice President Dick Cheney, a former \ntop executive of oilfield services giant Halliburton Co. to head a White \nHouse task force to come up with recommendations to solve America's energy \nproblems that includes the West's power crisis.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

So far this year, Enron's stock is down \nabout 37 percent, versus a 16 percent decline for Standard & Poor's utilities \nindex.\nSeeking to reassure investors, Enron issued a statement on Thursday saying it \nwas \"very comfortable\" with its 2001 earnings target of $1.70 to $1.75 per \ndiluted share. On average, Wall Street analysts expect Enron to post earnings \nof $1.74 per share, according to data compiled by Thomson Financial/First \nCall. \nThe Houston-based company said it was confident about its strong business \nprospects for the year, adding that it would host a conference call for \nanalysts and investors on Friday. \nAnalysts who track the company said the decline in its stock price did not \nappear to be related to business developments at Enron but rather to poor \nstock market sentiment, particularly in the areas of technology and \ntelecommunications. \n\"A lot of the breakout in Enron's stock in 2000 was in relation to their \nstrategy in new areas like business-to-business and broadband \ntelecommunications, and that's just out of favor right now,\" said CIBC World \nMarkets analyst William Hyler. \nBUILDING A BROADBAND BUSINESS \nSince early last year Enron has been building a high-speed broadband \ncommunications network that it plans to use as a base to build a bandwidth \nmarketing and trading business similar to its huge natural gas and \nelectricity trading operation. \nExcitement among investors about the broadband business and about Enron's \nsuccess in developing a strong Internet-based trading platform for energy and \nother commodities drove an 87 percent rise in the company's share price last \nyear, outpacing a gain of 54 percent for the S&P utilities index. \nOn Wednesday Enron spokesman Mark Palmer denied rumors of impending layoffs \nat the company's broadband unit, although he confirmed that staff were being \nredeployed within the business. \nSalomon Smith Barney analyst Ray Niles said in a research note that he was \nnot concerned about the redeployments, nor about the recent cancellation of a \ndeal with Blockbuster Inc. to deliver movies on-demand via Enron's broadband \nnetwork. \n\"We have always placed a greater value on the bandwidth trading portion of \nEnron's bandwidth strategy, rather than on content delivery,\" he said. Niles \nmaintained a Buy rating on the company's stock and a 12-18 month price target \nof $100. \nOther U.S. energy stocks were also broadly weaker on Thursday, reflecting \ninvestor's concerns that a global economic slowdown could lead to reduced \ndemand for energy and correspondingly lower prices for crude oil and natural \ngas. \nWilliams Cos., a company with a business mix similar to Enron's, saw its \nstock decline $3.34, or 8 percent, to $38.10. \nApache Corp., a leading U.S. oil and gas exploration company, was off $3.02, \nor 5 percent, at $57.20 while Halliburton Co., the world's biggest oilfield \nservices company, was down $1.61, or over 4 percent, at $37.18.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The state also should avoid\nsigning long-term supply contracts with high fixed prices, he said.\n     California has spent more than $3.2 billion this year buying\nelectricity for its nearly insolvent investor-owned utilities,\nwhich have been forced to buy power on the open market for more\nthan they can charge consumers under a 1996 state deregulation law.\nWith demand heavy and affordable wholesale power scarce, California\nhas endured rolling blackouts this week and in January.\n     ``If this crisis drives California back to the heavy-handed\nregulation that launched deregulation in the first place, or to an\nexpansive public power authority, then the state is likely to find\nits electric sector becoming increasingly inefficient and\nexpensive,'' Makovich's testimony said.\n     The state is attempting to buy the transmission lines of\nCalifornia's three largest utilities, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &\nElectric, Edison International's Southern California Edison and\nSempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric, to provide the utilities\nwith funds.\n     The state faces years of high energy payments by signing long-\nterm energy contracts with companies such as Calpine Corp., Enron\nCorp., and Duke Energy Corp. during a shortage, Makovich said.\nCalifornia could discourage investment needed to build new power\nplants by an attempt to gain ownership of much of California's\nelectricity grid, he added.\n     California has an energy shortage because no significant power\nplants were built in the state in the last decade, even as demand\nskyrocketed. Drier-than-normal weather has also reduced electricity\nsupplies from hydroelectric plants in the northwestern U.S.\n\n--Mark Johnson in the Princeton newsroom (609) 279-4017, or at\nmjohnson7@bloomberg.net /atr\n\n\nEnron Reaffirms 2001 Forecast After Stock Price Falls (Update1)\n2001-03-22 16:56 (New York)\n\nEnron Reaffirms 2001 Forecast After Stock Price Falls (Update1)\n\n     (Updates percentage decline in first paragraph and closes\nshares.)\n\n     Houston, March 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose shares\nhave fallen 17 percent in the past week on concern the company's\ntelecommunications business won't generate the expected profit,\nsaid it still expects to earn $1.70 to $1.75 a share this year.\n     The largest energy trader raised its 2001 profit estimate in\nJanuary, citing growth in European and North American trading and\nmore business from its fiber-optic network. It previously forecast\nprofit of $1.60 to $1.70 a share.\n     Enron's shares fell 11 percent on March 12 after the collapse\nof an agreement for Blockbuster Inc. to deliver movies on demand\nover Enron's fiber-optic system. The shares continued to fall this\nweek, partly on speculation Enron may exit the broadband business,\nCredit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer said in a report.\n     ``The market is panicked to a certain extent,'' said Dain\nRauscher Wessels analyst Mark Easterbrook, who has a ``strong\nbuy'' rating on Enron shares.\n     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 87 cents to $55.02 after\ntouching a 52-week low of $51.51 earlier.\n     ``Broadband is a core business of Enron's,'' spokesman Vance\nMeyer said. ``All of our businesses are doing very well, and we\nplan to hit our earnings targets, and that includes broadband.''\n     Investors also are concerned that falling natural-gas prices\nand California's energy crisis may hurt Enron's trading business,\nanalysts said. Enron also has failed to get the Indian government-\nowned Maharashtra State Electricity Board to pay its December\npower bill.\n     Easterbrook said he expects the shares to rebound once Enron\nreports first-quarter earnings on April 17.\n     ``The stock may act weak here, it may continue to act weak\nfor the next several days,'' he said. ``But I think first-quarter\nearnings will be a pretty good catalyst.''\n     The company is expected to earn 44 cents a share in the first\nquarter, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by First\nCall/Thomson Financial. It earned $338 million, or 40 cents, a\nyear earlier.\n\n(Enron has scheduled a conference call for tomorrow at 1 p.m. New\nYork time ``to provide investors with a general update on the\ncompany,'' it said.

The federal government is\nexpected to decide on the issue in a day or two, the paper said.\n\n(The Economic Times, 3-23, pg. 1)\n\nFor the Web site of the paper, click on {ECNT <GO>}.",

This could include demand buy down \nprograms, and laws the force utility financial solvency.\n\nEvery day is a new day but I am told this will likely be the status quo until \nthe congressional recess is over (recess is from 6-30 April).\n\nAlan Comnes ",

But coach Mack Brown said after the\nevening workout that an X-Ray showed no damage. He said Ellis probably will\nbe back at practice Wednesday.\nAfter losing TE Bo Scaife with a season-ending knee injury, the loss of\nEllis\nwould have been a severe blow to the team's receiving corps, and Brown said\nhe was elated when he found out the injury was minor. Ellis was held out of\nthe evening workout. Brown also said Scaife will undergo surgery on his\nknee\nFriday, and probably will be available for spring practice.\n* * * *\nBrown said Tuesday's first practice in full pads was a very good one, and\nhe\nsaid he is pleased with the second-team offense and defense.\n\"Last season, our first teams just went right through our second teams,\" he\nsaid. \"Our second teams are much better this year. The first teams can't\njust\nline up and ran over them anymore.\"\nHe also said the first-team offensive line played extremely well Tuesday.\nOffensive line coach Tim Nunez said Cory Quye has edged ahead of Mike\nWilliams for the starting job at right tackle, but he said both Quye and\nWilliams \"are having great practices.\"\nNunez also said backup guard Tillman Holloway, a redshirt freshman, \"has\ndone\na great job and is pushing for significant playing time.\"\n* * * *\nFreshmen WRs Roy Williams and B. J. Johnson both made several outstanding\ncatches Tuesday. Both also ran with the first team at times due to Ellis'\nabsence.\nI asked Brown how soon a true freshman could move into the starting lineup\nif\nhe demonstrated that he was better than the veterans. He said, \"As soon as\nwe\nwould see he's good enough to play consistently well. We wouldn't want to\nmove him up and then move him down, but if some of them play well enough to\nmove up, it probably would be next week.\"\nThere is no question right now that Williams and Ellis are the team's top\ntwo\nWRs, with Johnson close behind them. If Williams and Ellis are both healthy\non Sept. 9, expect them to be the starters in the season opener against\nLouisiana-Lafayette.\nDefensive coordinator Carl Reese said freshmen DEs Kalen Thornton and Adam\nDoiron have been looking good in practice. He said both of them should be\nable to help the team this season. \"They are big old boys who should be\nable\nto help us stop the run,\" he said. \"They both have good quickness and they\nare catching on fast.\"\n* * * *\nThe Longhorns will have a scrimmage at 5 p.m. Wednesday at Royal Memorial\nStadium. Brown urged Longhorn fans to come and show their support for the\nteam.\n* * * *\nFOOTBALL NOTES: Josh Doiron, older brother of the freshman DE, is walking\non\nas a TE. He attended Kansas State for a year on a football scholarship, but\nquit the team and attended Oklahoma last year. He did not play football at\nOU. After sitting out this year at Texas, he will have two years of\neligibility remaining. . . Brown said Hodges Mitchell is the Longhorns' No.\n1\npunt returner and Ivan Williams and Victor Ike are the top kickoff\nreturners.\n* * * *\nRECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns might sign a kicker this year. They have\ntwo\ngood freshmen kickers, but Brown likes to have competition at every spot,\nand\nhe probably will sign a kicker if he can find a great one. He would like to\nfind a punter who also can kick field goals.\n* * * *\nMy next fax will be Wednesday, August 23.\n* * * *\nThe True Orange Fax Service includes  at  least  99 faxes  a year and costs\n$99 ($79 by E-Mail).

The current forward=\r\n=20\r\nprice of power for the balance of the year is about $325 a megawatt-hour,=\r\n=20\r\nwhich would put California's spot-market bill at $13 billion for the=20\r\nremainder of the year. That figure is likely too low, however, because the=\r\n=20\r\nstate will be far shorter in the summer, when demand and prices are much=20\r\nhigher, than in the winter. The forward price of power for delivery this=20\r\nsummer is now averaging about $480 a megawatt-hour. Moreover, the shortfall=\r\n=20\r\ncould grow if some of the agreements in principle don't mature into actual=\r\n=20\r\ndeals, Freeman wrote.=20\r\nOn March 5, Freeman said the state had lined up contracts to cover 60% to 7=\r\n0%=20\r\nof the state's \"net short\" position this summer. The net short position is=\r\n=20\r\nthe difference between the power consumed by California's three largest=20\r\nutilities and the power those utilities generate themselves or have under=\r\n=20\r\ncontract. At that time, Freeman told Dow Jones Newswires that the summer=20\r\ndeals were only agreements in principle and not firm contracts. Freeman=20\r\nwasn't immediately available Wednesday for comment.=20\r\nIn his March 15 report to DWR Director Ray Hart, Freeman says the DWR has=\r\n=20\r\nentered into 19 final power contracts, with seven suppliers, and more than =\r\n25=20\r\nagreements in principle. In 2001, the state's deals cover at most 6,502=20\r\nmegawatts at any given time. Of that, only 2,247 megawatts are covered by=\r\n=20\r\nsigned contracts. Even that figure, however, is just an approximation, as=\r\n=20\r\nsome power is contingent upon availability or the completion of power plant=\r\ns=20\r\nthat might not be built in time, Freeman wrote.=20\r\nCoverage for 2002 so far is also slim, according to Freeman's report. The=\r\n=20\r\ndeals cover at most 7,500 megawatts at any given time, and the state will=\r\n=20\r\nstill face an uncovered short position of about 40 million megawatt-hours.=\r\n=20\r\nCalifornia put itself in the power markets in mid-January, when the=20\r\ndeteriorating finances of PG&E Corp. PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas &=20\r\nElectric Co. and Edison International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern=20\r\nCalifornia Edison left them unable to purchase power for themselves.=20\r\nThe state's idea was to sign lots of long-term deals, thus locking in=20\r\nsupplies and bringing down spot-market prices by reducing the level of pani=\r\nc=20\r\nbuying at the last minute. The hope was also that by spreading out the cost=\r\n=20\r\nof power over several years, the state could secure the electricity it need=\r\ns=20\r\nwithout raising consumers' rates.=20\r\nThose hopes are unlikely to be realized. As reported, California state=20\r\nTreasurer Phil Angelides has said a planned $10 billion municipal bond issu=\r\ne=20\r\n- the largest in U.S. history - will only cover the state's power purchases=\r\n=20\r\nthrough September if prices stay where they are. The California Department =\r\nof=20\r\nWater Resources, which is handling the state's power purchases, has already=\r\n=20\r\nspent about $3 billion on power, a total that is growing by about $45 milli=\r\non=20\r\na day.=20\r\nCalifornia lawmakers and regulators are increasingly saying consumers' rate=\r\ns=20\r\nwill have to rise to cover the cost of power bought on their behalf.=20\r\nThe West, heavily dependent on hydropower, is having one of its driest year=\r\ns=20\r\non record.

Send her down south to Portland if it looks like she's getting board with your \"itsy bitsy\".\n\nI've kept in touch with Carl and Brett but not much else.  Funny how time can just slip by.  I think back to the days in school and yup...just like I thought, everything seems so cool.  I think of how nice it would be to have scores of friends within a block and three bars to choose from... but it didn't seem that super at the time.  I specifically remember getting pissed on a Tuesday night, playing darts at Shakers with throngs of 20 something girls around and shrugging it off as \"boring\".  \n\nYou may be suprised to hear it, but I am still on with Enron and looking forward to a buyout in a week or so.  As strange as it may seem, this whole fiscad may have been a huge blessing in disguise...I'll just keep my fingers crossed.\n\nI'm doing a lot of skiing this year.  Let me know when and where we should meet up.  I'd like to see the likes of Toby, Ty, Nate, Ken and even Palmy.  \n\n\"got fuel to burn, got roads to ride\" -Neil Young\n\nDeano \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \"Dean, Craig\" <Craig.Dean@ENRON.com>\nDate: Mon, 24 Dec 2001 05:46:59 -0800\nTo:  <cdean12@earthlink.net>\nSubject: FW: You still suck at baseball....\n\n\n> \n> \n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Oliver Smith [mailto:olivermsmith@hotmail.com]\n> Sent: Monday, December 17, 2001 12:30 PM\n> To: Dean, Craig\n> Subject: You still suck at baseball....\n> \n> \n> CRAIG!\n> What the hell have you been up to?

Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  \n\nThe settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  \n\nWe want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.\n\nKen\n\n\n\nDear ETS Colleague:\n\nOn Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  \n\nIn this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.\n\nThe company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.\n\nBeginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  \n\nOver many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!\n\nStan",

This is a listing of what's been going on.\n\n\n            TIME PDH\nDATE     COMMODITY BOOK GIVEN TO TRADER   SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION\n\n8/25/00 ENPOWER - WEST  7:05    Original    West cash flows did not look \nright.  Valerie left voice mail\n         late Thursday night stating not to treat the $18M gain as\n          final.  She indicated that Lavorato was going to review the\n         cash flows  this morning and she will let us know the final\n          number at that time.  These cashflows created a $19,000\n         PV01 affect. \n        \n     7:45    Re-ran w/old West CF  After consulting with Pushkar, we \nreplaced  the new west              cash flows with prior days so hedging \ncould begin.\n\n    10:15   Final    Spoke with Monica Lande at 9:30am and she stated that \nthe             original cash flows received were real. We then had to \n         bring the original cash flows back and re-do the PDH \n         reports.\n\n8/28/00 refer to email sent by Sheila on this day.\n\n8/29/00 UK-NAP-LT-PRC 7:35     Cash flows received from the UK book looked \nreally weird. \n         The $38M cash flow curve change created a 15,000 PV01\n         affect.  We contacted Guy Freshwater regarding.  He\n         indicated that per Mark Fondren, the book was officialized \n         Monday, on Friday since Monday was a Holiday for their \n         Office.  We backed out the new cash flow, and then substituted\n         the old ones.\n\n8/30/00 UK-NAP-LT-PRC 7:30  Original    The same thing happened as 8/29/00.  \nThe book was not officialized  \n    7:45  Final    on 8/29, therefore we received the same incorrect cash \nflows.  We again\n         substituted these cash flows with those received on 8/25/00.  I \ntalked with\n         Mark Fondren and he indicated that the book has now been \nofficialized.\n         (In the past we have not had issues with the UK commodity Books in \nthe \n         ERMS system. )\n\n8/31/00 ENPOWER - WEST 7:20  Original    Cash flows received for west created \na 14,000 PV01 affect.  We contacted\n    8:00  Final    Monica Lande and she informed us that there was a $14 M \nloss in their book, \n         but $6 M was not real.  We asked for a cash flow strip for the \nincorrect flows, but          she was not able to provide it.  Therefore, we \nused the previous day's cash\n         flows.  After the 7:20 PDH report, the system started running slow, \ntherefore\n         it took even longer to produce a revised report. \n",

        "body": "Per our discussions last week about the Kern River open season.  I expect \nthese shippers to file the same types of comments in the new expansion.  FERC \nhas a policy prohibiting pipelines from selling more firm capacity than they \nhave at any point, so to the extent these shippers can show that Kern has \nindeed oversold Wheeler Ridge, I think that FERC will have to address their \nissue.  They surely don't want another El Paso on their hands.\n\n\nNGI's Daily Gas Price Index \npublished : March 21, 2001\n\nShippers Dispute Kern's Wheeler Ridge Sales\n\nChevron, Amoco Production, CanWest Gas Supply, Aera Energy and RME Petroleum \nhave called on FERC to stop Kern River Gas Transmission from overselling \ndelivery point rights at Wheeler Ridge into the Southern California Gas Co. \ndistribution system. The Firm Shippers said in comments filed this week that, \nin a situation strangely similar to the recent El Paso capacity reallocation \ncase, Kern River has oversold capacity at Wheeler Ridge, and its proposed \nexpansion project will only exacerbate the situation (Docket CP01-31). \n\nOn Nov. 15, 2000, Kern filed an application to expand its system and provide \n74,500 Dth/d of additional delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge into \nSoCal Gas. But Firm Shippers claim recent data provided by Kern and SoCal Gas \nindicates Kern River already has sold more than the 450 MMcf/d of firm \ndelivery point capacity it has available into Wheeler Ridge. Firm Shippers \ntold FERC. Kern River has sold 468.4 MMcf/d of capacity at Wheeler Ridge. \n\nNot true, says Lynn Dahlberg, Kern's manager of marketing. \"We have to date \nsubscribed at 450,000 dth/d. And unless we subscribe at more than 830,000 \ndth/d, we have not sold more capacity than SoCal has takeaway.\" The combined \nKern-Mojave lines can deliver on a firm basis 600,000 dth/d, with Kern having \n450,00 and Mojave 150,000. \"We can move more than that capacity, and we \nhave,\" she added. \n\nSoCal Gas has noted that it curtails nominations from Kern on a regular \nbasis, Shippers said. With the proposed expansion project, Kern will be \n\"creating the same type of firm delivery point over-sale situation that the \nCommission found to be unjust and unreasonable on El Paso Natural Gas at El \nPaso's SoCal Gas/Topock delivery point,\" they added. While they support the \nexpansion, they do not want to see their firm delivery rights in Southern \nCalifornia degraded. They also complained that Kern's marketing affiliate is \none of the primary beneficiaries of the proposed additional access to Wheeler \nRidge. \n\nDahlberg conceded that other interstate lines also deliver to the Wheeler \nRidge point, but \"adding more players to Wheeler gives markets on Socal more \nsupply options. Shippers have to compete.\" \n\nThe shippers are concerned, however that \"substantial benefits under the \ncurrently structured proposal accrue primarily to Kern River and its \naffiliate and would restrict the firm rights of existing shippers....\" The \nCommission should prohibit Kern from selling additional firm rights at \nWheeler Ridge, or provide only rights to secondary and tertiary capacity that \nis of a lower priority than the rights of existing firm customers, they said.

Morrow's (and while her name wasn't on this  bill,?it \nwas as much Sen. Alpert's) bill on eliminating any tariff  that discriminates \nagainst DER.? SBX 9 was derived from the omnibus  DER bill SBX 35 which is \nstill alive and contains many important  provisions fro removing additional \nbarriers.? Yesterday's vote  represents a major win because even if the bill \nultimately does not get  enacted, a very important statement has been made by \nthe committee.?  I'm sure the CPUC will take notice in their  proceedings.\n?\nThe DER community  owes much thanks to Sen.'s Morrow and Alpert, and the \nUtilities Committee  Members and their staffs:\nSen. Bowen  (Chair)\nSen.  Alarcon\nSen.  Battin\nSen.  Dunn\nSen.  Murray\nSen.  Poochigian\nSen.  Sher\nSen.  Speier\nSen.  Vasconcellos\nSen.  Vincent\n?\nAlso much thanks to  everyone who worked incredibly hard and diligently on \nthis effort.?  From the business, consumer advocacy, environmental, \ngovernment,  manufacturing, and real estate communities.\n?\nHere are the  highlights of yesterday's actions:\n?\n\nFor IOU's- No  discriminatory tariffs for new DER installed between May 1, \n2000 and  June 1, 2003 if DER is in combined heat and power mode.? If you  \nhave a peaking unit with gen only, then you have until??July 1  2001, to get \nit installed.? \nDER installed within  the window gets the exemption until June 1, 2011.  \nThe maximum capacity  of the DER is 5 MW in aggregate per site.  \nThe DER must have  emissions levels of 9 PPM or better until the ARB \nestablished new  guidelines and standards, expected late this year or early \nnext  year.  \nCustomers with DER  are still required to pay interconnection, public purpose \ncharges, and  obligations incurred under the Dept. of Water Resources energy \npurchases  program.  \nThe CPUC shall  require the electrical corporations to include non-utility \nowned DER in  its planning process.  \nThe CPUC is required to  establish a firewall so that in the event that the \nimplementation of DER  results in net costs to the system, those costs stay \nwithin the customer  class.  \nThe CPUC shall  require the utilities to establish new rates for DER that \nare  non-discriminatory and take into account the benefits as well as the  \ncosts.  \nMuni's are required  to review their tariffs for barriers to entry and hold \npublic meetings  to solicit comment for recommended changes.\n\nNow we have momentum,  but there is still a tremendous amount of work to do \non the Assembly side  and with Governor's office.? We need the continued \n(increased)  support of all of you as we move this forward.\n\nSteven A.

Some clarification and a question:\n\nClarification:\nEnlighten (certainly in London) is actually a data hub, rather than an \napplication.  In itself, it will not add business value.  However, the tools \nwhich sit on top of this system will add business value.  These tools are \ncurrently DTL, Envoice, Zebra.  However, I think we all anticipate more \nrequirements being developed as this central data store becomes richer.\n\nQuestion (for business sponsors):\nWe are trying hard to coordinate US and UK efforts.  However, this will be \nextremely difficult if our respective business timelines are not the same.  \nSay - for example - Mike wants Enlighten to deliver volumetric reporting by \nthen end of 2000 but Cindy instead wants a full DPR in the same timeline.  \nOur data architects are going to struggle to coordinate and prioritise their \nwork if we are working for two separate sets of masters.  So:\n\nIf we are really to reap the rewards of a UK/US implementation, a common \ntimetable is extremely important.  Who are our primary UK and US business \nsponsors and can we ask them to agree a mutual timeline ?  I suspect if we \nare to try and make this a joint development, nothing will make delivery \nharder than having separate and sometimes mutually exclusive sets of \nrequirements from our user communities.  \n\nComments/answers please...\n\nCheers\n\nJohn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, it would appear that TURN is looking to roll back the \nclock on any progress we might have made in the GIR process to separate \nutility services and make them independently available to the marketplace.  \nOn that basis, I'd say you've got a reasonable argument to make.  \n\nAs far as Transwestern is concerned, I'd say that, as a general matter, we \noppose any change in regulations that would attempt to repackage or rebundle \nutility services that gives the effect of reducing customer choice.  On the \nother hand, given the backdrop of a frustrated effort in the GIR proceeding, \nas long as they're leaving Hector Road alone, its hard for me to get too \nfired up about anything in California these days.  \n\nLet us know if there is anything you'd like us to do here.

        "body": "\nEarlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.\n \nWe are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.\n \nIf you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.\n \nThank you for your support.\n \nEnron Global Technology\n \n \n \n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON on behalf of Enron Messaging Administration \nSent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM \nTo: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON \nCc: \nSubject: Supported Internet Email Addresses\n\n\n\nEnron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where \"name\" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.\n\nAny new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.\n\nTo determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any \"spaces\" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.\n\nIMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.\n\nWe will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.\n\nThank you for participation, cooperation and support. \n\nEnron Messaging Administration",

If OK, I would like to forward to Tim on Monday.\n\nI revised Steve's statement of how to measure benefits.  As I read it, it \nseem cleaner to measure benefits accross interfaces (PNW-CA; DSW-CA) rather \nthan for each region seperately.\n\nIf you do it my way, price actually falls out of the equation and you \nestimate benefits simply by measuring flow times incremental production costs \non both sides of the interface.  (That being said, I also propose measuring \neconomic benefit of trade using basis differentials rather than estimated \ncosts.  Thoughts on which approach is better are welcome).\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Walton\n03/07/2001 09:45 AM\nTo: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, James D \nSteffes/NA/Enron@Enron\ncc:  \n\nSubject: Interconnection Benefits\n\nEnclosed is a first cut at a very rough approximation of interchange \nbenefits.  It assumes that the benefit to the exporting parties is a \ncontribution to their fixed costs of capacity of base load plants already \nbuilt equal to the difference between the sale price and the cost of fuel \n(estimated from gas combined cycle operation).  The tricky part is trying to \nunravel exports from the Southwest from the ownership shares of California \nparties.  The gain to California is (1) the capital savings of added peaking \nplants and (2) the variable cost savings from not operating high heat rate \nunits.  \n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "AB 1890 Group:\n\nA response to the ISO's recent message regarding CMUA's proposed language is\nnecessary.\n\nFirst, CMUA proposed its language to the Group on participation of municipal\nSystem Units during the week of August 21st, and discussed the matter at\nlength with the Group when ISO representatives were in attendance and\ncommenting on various drafting suggestions. Any implication that there is an\nelement of surprise associated with the CMUA language is unfounded.  If\nanything, it is the ISO's latest suggestion to remove the language that is\ntardy.  The Letter underwent several iterative changes, during which time\nthe ISO had an opportunity to make constructive suggestions to modify the\nlanguage (preferably), or at a minimum explain its position so that the\nGroup could consider the issue.\n\nSecond, the ISO indicates that \"there is ongoing and longstanding litigation\nover how to bring MUNIs into the ISO system,\" as a reason for not including\nthe language in the proposed Letter.  Certainly, the fact that an issue is\nbeing litigated is not a distinguishing characteristic.  What issue hasn't\nbeen litigated, including Load participation in ISO Ancillary Service\nmarkets?! As we fully discussed with the Group, there are a host of issues\nassociated with municipal/ISO discussions, including ISO cost allocation to\nLoad.  CMUA's specific proposal is to uncouple issues of transmission and\nLoad cost allocation from the issue of getting generation capacity into the\nmarkets.  It is unfortunate that, when we all recognize that we need more\ncapacity in the ISO markets to deepen supply, the ISO is taking a position\nto hold on to \"chits\" in an effort to strengthen its hand on transmission\nand Load cost allocation issues.  The end result is that generation is not\nin the ISO markets (whatever the exact number, it is far in excess of\nseveral of the other recommendations made in the letter) because the issue\nis being held hostage for negotiating purposes on issues that have nothing\nto do with supply.\n\nAt this point, it appears we will not have agreement on this matter.  In the\npast, the Group has acted as a consensus organization.  CMUA would like the\ngroup to consider how the letter is characterized to the Governor, or anyone\nelse, if one or more members have remaining concerns.\n\nTony Braun\nBraun & Associates, P.C.\n915 L Street\nSuite 1460\nSacramento, California 95814\n(916) 441-1733\n(916) 441-4053 (facsimile)\nbraun@braunlegal.com\n\nCounsel to CMUA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Larson, Robin [mailto:RLarson@caiso.com]\nSent: Monday, September 18, 2000 10:42 AM\nTo: 'Karen Edson'; dhunter@smithandkempton.com; 'Aaron Thomas (E-mail)';\n'Allan Lippincott'; 'Ann Cohn (E-mail)'; 'Ann Watson'; 'Anna Ferrera\n(E-mail)'; 'Art Carter'; 'assistant for John Fielder'; Barkovich,\nBarbara; Kilbourne, Becky; 'Bill Booth (E-mail)'; 'Bill Dombrowski';\n'Bill Keese (E-mail)'; 'Bill Zobel (E-mail)'; 'Bob Foster'; 'Bob\nHouston'; 'Carolyn McIntyre (E-mail)'; 'Carolyn Veal-Hunter (E-mail)';\n'Catherine Hackney (E-mail)'; 'Charles Bacchi (E-mail)'; 'Craig Brown';\n'Dan Carroll (E-mail)'; Cazalet, Denise; 'Dennis Price (E-mail)'; 'Denny\nSamuel'; 'Dominic DiMare'; 'Dorothy Rothrock (E-mail)'; 'Ed Yates';\n'Eloy Garcia (E-mail)'; Elsesser, Evelyn; Heath, Gary; 'Gordon\nMcDonald'; 'Jack Flanigan'; 'Jack Gualco (E-mail)'; 'Jack Stewart';\n'James Boyd'; 'Jan Smutny-Jones (E-mail)'; 'Jeff Dasovich (E-mail)';\nJordan, Jerry; 'Jim Cassie (E-mail)'; 'Jim Groniger (E-mail)'; 'Joe\nLyons (E-mail)'; Ronan, Joe; 'John Bridges (E-mail)'; 'John Fielder';\n'John Fistolera (E-mail)'; 'John Larrea (E-mail)'; 'John Rozsa\n(E-mail)'; 'John White (E-mail)'; 'Joseph Alamo'; 'Julia Wright'; 'Karen\nJarrell (E-mail)'; Koyano, Karen; Lindh, Karen; 'Karen Mills (E-mail)';\n'Kari Harteloo'; 'Kathy Brandenburg'; 'Kay Grosulak (E-mail)'; 'Keith\nMcCrea (E-mail)'; 'Kevin Lynch (E-mail)'; Smith, Kevin; 'Lawrence\nLingbloom (E-mail)'; 'Lenny Goldberg (E-mail)'; 'Louis Szablya\n(E-mail)'; 'Marc Joseph (E-mail)'; 'Marwan Masri (E-mail)'; 'Mary\nMcDonald (E-mail)'; Alcantar, Michael; Florio, Mike; 'Mike Kahl'; 'Mona\nPetrochko (E-mail)'; 'Pete Conaty (E-mail)'; 'Phil Nails'; 'Phil Stohr\n(E-mail)'; 'Ralph Cavanagh (E-mail)'; 'Randy Chinn (E-mail)'; 'Ray\nThompson (E-mail)'; 'Rick Counihan'; Berry, Robert; Larson, Robin;\n'Sheryl Carter (E-mail)'; 'Steve Pike (E-mail)'; 'Stu Wilson (E-mail)';\nMara, Sue; 'Susan Reeder (E-mail)'; Winter, Terry; Dinkel, Tom; 'Tim\nSchmelzer (E-mail)'; 'Tommy Ross'; 'Tony Braun'; 'Victoria Schaefer\n(E-mail)'\nCc: Winter, Terry\nSubject: RE: IMPORTANT -- Letter to Governor Davis\n\n\nI do not have a comment on Karen's edit, but I wanted to email the entire\ngroup about CMUA's insistence on keeping Proposal 8 under the generation\nsection. (This is the section referencing potential MUNI units that could be\nbid into the ISO A/S market if we can figure out a way to avoid having them\njoin formally). I had mentioned when this was first brought up--which was\nfrankly rather late in the drafting game--that I thought this would be very\ncontroversial at ISO. Not only does ISO not concur with the notion that\nthere would be \"over 1000 MW of addiitonal supply into A/S markets\" but\nplacing this language in a letter to the Governor makes it look like ISO is\nthe obstacle to having these units available.  There is ongoing and\nlongstanding litigation over how to bring MUNIs into the ISO system.  I am\nnot uncomfortable with discussing this issue at any AB 1890 meeting, but\nforcing the issue in this Governor's letter is not placing the issue on a\nlevel playing field in my opinion.\n\nIf CMUA decides not to sign the letter without this controversial piece that\nwill be unfortunate.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Karen Edson [mailto:kedson@ns.net]\nSent: Thursday, September 14, 2000 1:19 PM\nTo: dhunter@smithandkempton.com; 'Aaron Thomas (E-mail)'; 'Allan\nLippincott'; 'Ann Cohn (E-mail)'; 'Ann Watson'; 'Anna Ferrera (E-mail)';\n'Art Carter'; 'assistant for John Fielder'; 'Barbara Barkovich\n(E-mail)'; 'Becky Kilbourne'; 'Bill Booth (E-mail)'; 'Bill Dombrowski';\n'Bill Keese (E-mail)'; 'Bill Zobel (E-mail)'; 'Bob Foster'; 'Bob\nHouston'; 'Carolyn McIntyre (E-mail)'; 'Carolyn Veal-Hunter (E-mail)';\n'Catherine Hackney (E-mail)'; 'Charles Bacchi (E-mail)'; 'Craig Brown';\n'Dan Carroll (E-mail)'; 'Denice Cazalet'; 'Dennis Price (E-mail)';\n'Denny Samuel'; 'Dominic DiMare'; 'Dorothy Rothrock (E-mail)'; 'Ed\nYates'; 'Eloy Garcia (E-mail)'; 'Evelyn Elsesser (E-mail)'; 'Gary Heath\n(E-mail)'; 'Gordon McDonald'; 'Jack Flanigan'; 'Jack Gualco (E-mail)';\n'Jack Stewart'; 'James Boyd'; 'Jan Smutny-Jones (E-mail)'; 'Jeff\nDasovich (E-mail)'; 'Jerry Jordan'; 'Jim Cassie (E-mail)'; 'Jim Groniger\n(E-mail)'; 'Joe Lyons (E-mail)'; 'Joe Ronan'; 'John Bridges (E-mail)';\n'John Fielder'; 'John Fistolera (E-mail)'; 'John Larrea (E-mail)'; 'John\nRozsa (E-mail)'; 'John White (E-mail)'; 'Joseph Alamo'; 'Julia Wright';\n'Karen Jarrell (E-mail)'; 'Karen Koyano (E-mail)'; 'Karen Lindh'; 'Karen\nMills (E-mail)'; 'Kari Harteloo'; 'Kathy Brandenburg'; 'Kay Grosulak\n(E-mail)'; 'Keith McCrea (E-mail)'; 'Kevin Lynch (E-mail)'; 'Kevin Smith\n(E-mail)'; 'Lawrence Lingbloom (E-mail)'; 'Lenny Goldberg (E-mail)';\n'Louis Szablya (E-mail)'; 'Marc Joseph (E-mail)'; 'Marwan Masri\n(E-mail)'; 'Mary McDonald (E-mail)'; 'Michael Alcantar (E-mail)'; 'Mike\nFlorio (E-mail)'; 'Mike Kahl'; 'Mona Petrochko (E-mail)'; 'Pete Conaty\n(E-mail)'; 'Phil Nails'; 'Phil Stohr (E-mail)'; 'Ralph Cavanagh\n(E-mail)'; 'Randy Chinn (E-mail)'; 'Ray Thompson (E-mail)'; 'Rick\nCounihan'; 'Robert Berry (E-mail)'; 'Robin Larson (E-mail)'; 'Sheryl\nCarter (E-mail)'; 'Steve Pike (E-mail)'; 'Stu Wilson (E-mail)'; 'Sue\nMara'; 'Susan Reeder (E-mail)'; 'Terry Winter (E-mail)'; 'Thomas Dinkel\n(E-mail)'; 'Tim Schmelzer (E-mail)'; 'Tommy Ross'; 'Tony Braun';\n'Victoria Schaefer (E-mail)'\nSubject: RE: IMPORTANT -- Letter to Governor Davis\n\n\n\nDelaney -\n\nIEP has one minor edit to the draft letter and three edits to the\nrecommendations.

        "body": "Good Morning Jeff,\n\nCatherine is out of the office until Tuesday 3/20/01.  Not wanting to keep \nyou waiting for a reply, I thought it best to give you some feedback \nimmediately.  \n\nThe great majority of CAD's customers in CA are core.  CAD does not knowingly \nterminate any current customer prior to their expiration date. The reasons \nwhy CAD's customers are turned back to the utility are as follows:\n\n1) Upon receiving renewal pricing from the CAD rep,  the customer chooses to \nreturn to the utility.\n\n2) Understanding that the current minimum margin per meter for our customers \nis approximately $300, those customers that have extremely low annual volumes \nare sent attrition letters and turned back to the LDC, at the end of their \ncontract.  We cannot competitively price this type of customer versus the \nutility, and extract enough margin to support them. Currently in the \nCalifornia markets (PG&E, SDG&E, & SOCAL) , there exists approximately 50 \ncustomers that have usages so low that given current market conditions, we \nwill not choose to renew the contracts.  The expiration dates for these are \nbetween 5/30/2001 and 2/28/2005.\n\n3) The customer initiates a request for termination prior to the end of their \ncontractual expiration date.  As we are all aware, California customers, \nspecifically those with either an index or NYMEX product, experienced a large \nswing in their pricing during the past few months.  CAD has been inundated \nwith customers requesting to be returned to their LDC.  Although we seek to \nsatisfy our customer to the best of our ability,  returning these customers \nto the utility is the LAST thing we want to do!!!!!!!  \n\nThe steps we have taken to address this issue is to:\n a) work with customer service/credit to offer extended payment options to \nease the effect of the increase.\n b) offer to restructure the customer's contract, and reprice the customer on \na fixed price product; minimizing their risk going forward.\n c) explain to the customer, in more detail, the reasons why this has \noccurred, and how, going forward, the index/NYMEX pricing has eased.  \n\nShould you have additional questions, please reply or call.\n-Jim\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON on 03/15/2001 04:50 PM CST\nSent by: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON\nTo: Catherine Woods/DUB/EES@EES, Dennis Harris/DUB/EES@EES, James D \nFoster/DUB/EES@EES\ncc: Roger O Ponce/HOU/EES@EES, Catherine Woods/DUB/EES@EES, James D \nSteffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Karen \nDenne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, mpalmer@enron.com, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Harry \nKingerski/NA/Enron@Enron, Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES, smccubbi@enron.com, \nsmara@enron.com, Leslie Lawner/NA/Enron@Enron, Rebecca W \nCantrell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard B \nSanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Shelley Corman/Enron@EnronXGate, Mike D \nSmith/HOU/EES@EES \nSubject: More Inquiries From CA PUC re: Switching customers back to LDC\n\nGreetings:\n \nRecall that about 3 weeks we got a call from a CA PUC staffer asking whether \nwe'd switched a particular gas customer (or two) back to the LDC.  We looked \ninto it and discovered that we'd mistakenly switched the customer back due to \na mix up about the fact that the customer had two active meters behind two \ndifferent utilities.  We informed the PUC staffer of the mix-up and explained \nthat the situation would be resolved.  \n\nThe questions from the staffer arose because the CA PUC made a bad decision a \ncouple of months ago. When gas prices ran up at the California border a lot \nof large (\"noncore\") customers attempted to switch back to the utility tariff \nin the hope of lowering gas costs.  In response, SoCalGas filed with the \nCommission asking the PUC to prohibit customers from switching back.  The \nCommission agreed and put the prohibition in place.  The Commission is now \nconcerned that if suppliers terminate their contracts with customers (for \nwhatever reason), or choose not to renew the contracts when they expire, \ncustomers won't have the option of returning to LDC service.\n\nToday, I received a letter from the President of the Commission asking me to \nrespond to the following:\n\nHave you \"stopped selling and delivering natural gas to any non-core \ncustomers with whom you have an existing procurement contract, or...notified \nany of your non-core customers that you do not intend to renew an existing \nnatural gas commodity procurement contract.  If your company has stopped or \nintends to stop serving non-core customers, the CPUC also needs to know\n\nhow many contracts you have terminated or expect to terminate\nthe natural gas volumes involved\nthe location of the non-core customer(s)\nthe reason(s) your company intends or has already acted to terminate those \ncontracts.\"\n\nThere's a good chance that the letter from the President of the Commission is \nlinked to the fact that we've recently switched our electricity customers \nback to utility service in California.  \n\nPrior to deciding whether and how to respond to the Commissioner, I'm trying \nto get handle on whether we're re-sourcing any gas retail customers to the \nutility prior to expiration, choosing not to renew contracts once they've \nexpired, etc.  Catherine, or Jim Foster, can you help out?  Thanks.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n",

THANKS.\n\nThe FT/RDI   March  14  California Conference  call discussed the plight of  \nCalifornia\nutilities and customers.  California  is  a state with IOUs on the verge of \nbankruptcy,\nthat  wants  to  buy up the utilities power grid  assets that is now seeing, \nafter more  than\na  year of  constant  natural gas  price hikes,  gas prices starting to \ndecrease.  There  are 3 ways \nfor California  to get out of  this electricty supply bind  and ease off its \npower price spikes:  add\ngeneration over capacity;  have retail users   reduce peak use consumption  \nand find\nmethods  to  use  cheaper storage of power.  The latter is not  available and \nthe first \nwill  eventually  be  available  medium  term.  Thus  dynamic pricing \nprograms  could \nhelp  the retail  power decrease  strategy.  The  California  crisis is \nindirectly  causing several\nother states  to stall their  deregulation progress, namely  Oklahoma, \nArkansas, Nevada and Missouri.\n\nFifty  percent  of US power load is used by  1 percent  of customers--the \nindustrials.\nIn California, the industrials  are only  one-third of  one percent  of \ncustomers  and they use\n25 percent  of  the  electricity in the  state.  Going  to this industrial \nmarket  and using\ntechnoogy and pricing to   conserve  electricity  use would go a long way  \ntowards reducing peak\ndemand use.   RDI  believes the gas infrastructure in the US is  there for  \n100  GW of new\ngas power plants, but many local hookups must be done to meet  super peak \ndays on\na localized basis.  California  is racing   to get  5 or  6 peakers  by this \nsummer yet there may not be enough gas\nthis summer to fill their  needs.  Plans  to add  capacity inside  the  \nstate   to receive  gas at the border\nare lagging  the plans of   interstates  to  add capacity.  \n\nSummer peak use may  be just  as difficult to meet in the US  as winter    \npeaks  have been.  As new merchant plants come online on a  regional  basis   \ndifferentials will change  a lot.   But most pressure on prices medium term \nwill be\ndownward, and the  items to watch   is  where/when the  new supplies  show up \nand  where the\nnew niche interconnects   get  built.   In California  the  Gov. does not \nwant  to  let power prices  go above current price  caps  and  this  will be  \nhard for him to do  and  still give price  signals  that  will  take off \ndemand\nat the  peak of the market.  Average electricity demand  growth annually  in \nCalifornia  has  been about  3 percent per\nyear  since   1998 but   less  than 1 percent of new capacity  has been  \nadded.  In concluding remarks, RDI's  John Egan\nnoted  due to the expected  crush of  changes, market vigilence   will be \ncritical  for the  successful  participants in the gas and power markets  \nover the next  few years.",

To address your points below:\n\n1)  I agree that your team should be involved in the planning of each \nindividual review although I am under the impression that Ted & Sally (by \nproxy Cassandra and I) would set the scope & timing of the reviews while your \ngroup would be looped in to the planning for each individual process.  If my \nunderstanding is incorrect, please let me know.  \n\n2) I agree that it would be useful for everyone to attend all meetings.  \nHowever, due to the limited time we have from arriving at the doorstep to \ndelivery of the report to Ted and Sally, your group really has to be focused \non completing the deal test.    We don't need three different people \nobtaining the same information at the same meetings.  If there has been a \nchange in your group's role from what I originally understood (we need lower \nlevel people from your team who would be able to execute a deal test) , we \nmay have to add additional resources to do the actual deal test to ensure it \nis done on time (by the time we leave the site). \n\n3)  Agreed - I'd like to hear what Donna and Mike Neeves have resolved as far \nas the database is concerned before we meet again.\n\nBest regards\n\nShona\n\n\n\nTo: Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@ENRON\ncc: Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Cassandra \nSchultz/NA/Enron@Enron, Lynn \nBellinghausen/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENt, Donna Lowry/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: updates to processes  \n\nShona:  Thank you for your memo.  I think it is a good idea to define roles \nand responsibilities and I appreciate the fact  that you have taken the \ninitiative to do so.  However, I do have the following comments:\n\n1) I have some accountability to Rick Buy for the success of this effort, \ntherefore I (or my designee) need to be involved in Doorstep pre- planning \nand post-mortem.  I will be involved in reviewing the final report before \npresentation and will attend  the meeting when the report is presented to Buy \nand Causey.\n\n2) I realize that  in the interest of getting a review done timely it is \nsometimes necessary to \"divide and conquer\".  However, where logistically \npossible, I believe that it makes sense for my people to be involved in \nmeetings held with Commercial personnel.  This facilitates understanding \noperations, document flow, points of contact, report writing as well as \nfurthering our goal of educating \"multi-functional\" people so that we can \ncontinue to reduce the resources necessary to perform these reviews.\n\n3) There are still some detailed issues that need to be clarified regarding \nthe database.  Let's schedule another meeting with Cassandra and Donna.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions,         Regards,       Rick\n\n",

The paper is on our website \n(www.epsa.org) titled an Initial Analysis of Recent Wholesale Price, Price \nCaps and Their Effect on Competitive Bulk Power Markets.  If anyone needs a \ncopy, let us know.  He also spoke for EPSA at the January FERC conference on \nmarket monitoring.\n\nJulie Simon\nVice President of Policy\nElectric Power Supply Association\njsimon@epsa.org\n\n>>> \"Katie Kaplan\" <kaplan@iepa.com> 03/16/01 03:30PM >>>\nGreetings:\nYesterday at the ISO several of us were successful in communicating the need\nfor a more diverse \"Market Repair Team\" that would include perhaps some\nadditional members and a \"Stakeholder Advisory Committee\".  We were also\nsuccessful in communicating our cost-benefit analysis and delaying the\nimmediate adoption of the team. The motion (approved 5-0) read:\n\nBoard of Governors Market Repair Team\nMOVED, that the Board approve the concept of a Market Repair Team along the\nlines described in the Florio memorandum of March 14, 2001, and directs ISO\nmanagement to provide a response to the proposal addressing among other\nissues, issues of cost/ benefit, conflicts of interest, team composition at\nthe next Board meeting.\n\nIEP, CMUA, SMUD, and Grid Services were all asked to submit some proposed\nnames by today to the ISO Management, please see below e-mail from Elaina:\n\nToday during the Public Comment, you all indicated that you might have names\nas potential members of the Advisory Group for the Market Repair Team.  It\nis not clear at this point how the whole process will be structured, but we\nhave been asked to put together a proposed game plan including names for\npotential members of the Advisory Group.  Please send them to me ask quickly\nas you can:  Friday pm is what Chairman Kahn asked for.\n\nWe would like to be as responsive as possible to the request and have\nthought of the idea of proposing someone that EPSA uses in a variety of\nroles.  CMUA will also probably be proposing someone from their national\norganization.  The name that has been suggested for IEP to submit is Craig\nRoach of Boston Pacific consulting who has done extensive work for EPSA in\nsupporting a competitive market policy. There is more information on Dr.\nRoach and Boston Consulting on their web site www.bostonpacific.com.  I\nspoke with Julie Simon at EPSA this morning and she also gave him an\nenthusiastic endorsement.\n\nAnother idea or an additional person to submit  would be an economist that\nis involved heavily in California.  Since both Hogan and Joskow have\nfinancial ties to market participants we may want to consider proposing our\nown economist.  It is the plan to submit both names to the ISO as well as a\nletter addressing the following:\n\n\n1. Raise very gently the issue of potential conflict of interest, coupled\nwith cost/benefit analysis etc\n2. Address structural issues, including how stakeholders will participate.\n3. Propose more diversity for the Market Repair Team,\n4. Propose a Stakeholder Advisory Group as a third box, and include\nstakeholders, including a regional perspective like neighboring control\nareas, and folks with operational and market experience\n\n\n\nIt is crucial that if this plan sends up any red flags for you that you get\nback to me ASAP.  I will be sending this letter to the ISO this afternoon\nafter we get the logistics worked out.  IF you have problems with this\ndirection please supply additional names we can route with the group.

        "body": "This article has the angle I spoke of on yesterday's call ...\n\n\n State reviews draft plan to prohibit energy exports \nPublished Sunday, March 11, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News \nBY STEVE JOHNSON \n\nMercury News \n\n\nTo the concern of some of its neighbors, California appears to be getting \nmore serious about the idea of banning its electricity generators from \nselling to other states on days when power supplies here are critically short.\n\nA draft proposal to prohibit such exports was circulated late last week by \nthe California Independent System Operator, which oversees most of the \nstate's power grid. Although officials there could not be reached for \ncomment, the proposal said the agency plans to seek approval for the ban from \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which supervises power wholesalers.\n\nThe proposal would require California generators ``to make full capacity \navailable'' to this state when electricity reserves dip below 7 percent, a \ncondition that results in a Stage 1 emergency. Rolling blackouts can result \nafter a Stage 3 emergency, when reserves fall below 1.5 percent.\n\nGov. Gray Davis and other California officials have been mulling over the \nidea of such a ban for months. They are concerned about California's power \nbeing shipped elsewhere, particularly when the state is scrambling to find \nenough electricity to keep the lights on.\n\nA Mercury News analysis in December found that thousands of \nCalifornia-generated megawatts -- enough to supply several million homes -- \nwere routinely being sold to other states during hours when power here was \ncritically short.\n\nIn addition, the draft proposal said banning exports could help prevent \ngenerators from engaging in ``megawatt laundering,'' in which they \nartificially inflate the price of their power by selling it out of state to \nan affiliate or an associate and then back into California just before it is \nneeded. While in-state power suppliers are somewhat limited in what they can \ncharge, no such constraints apply to power sold into California during \nelectrical emergencies.\n\nBut because California is highly dependent on electricity imports, some \nexperts fear that banning energy exports could backfire. They said other \nstates that periodically rely on power from California might retaliate by \nbarring their generators from selling power to the state.\n\n``Steps that would essentially Balkanize the intertie could be \ncounterproductive,'' said David Danner, energy policy adviser to Washington \nGov. Gary Locke, in reference to the major high-voltage line known as the \nintertie that links California to the Pacific Northwest.\n\nDanner praised Davis' recent efforts to solve California's energy problems. \nEven so, he said, any restriction on the flow of electricity could provoke \nanger in Washington state, where record-low rainfall has hurt the ability of \nthe region's hydroelectric dams to make power and where some residents have \nseen their utility bills soar.\n\n``I get calls every day from people . . . who say, `Why should I sit in the \ndark when all the power gets shipped to California?' '' said Danner, noting \nthat Washington residents have been asked to drastically cut back on their \nelectricity this year. ``There is some resentment.''\n\nRoy Hemmingway, an energy specialist in the office of Oregon Gov. John \nKitzhaber, expressed concern that the proposed ban would hinder what he \ncalled ``the mutually advantageous exchange of power between the Pacific \nNorthwest and California.\n\n``We in Oregon are pretty sympathetic to the extremely difficult situation \nthat California is facing,'' he said. Even so, he added, ``I am hoping this \nproposal would have some flexibility in it.''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\n\nContact Steve Johnson at sjohnson@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5043.\n\n\n\n\n# # #   \n \n ",

Missouri took the ball and Marcus James ran\nthe UT kick back to the 38. The Longhorn defense forced a quick three-and-out\nand the UT offense had its most time-consuming drive of the year, going 78\nyards in a laborious 10-minute, 19-play drive to the Tiger 2, but Dusty\nMangum missed the chip-shot field goal. Missouri went three-and-out again.\nThe Horns drove to midfield again, but stalled as the quarter ended. Texas\nhad a huge lead in statistics, with 7 first downs to 0 for Missouri, a 99-24\nedge in total offense, and a 12:03 to 2:57 bulge in time of possession, but\nthe game was all even at 0-0 in the only statistic that counts.\nSecond Quarter\nThe Tigers finally got their offense untracked to start the second quarter\nand drove 76 yards, primarily on the passing of QB Kirk Farmer, to take a 7-0\nlead with 11:12 left. Victor Ike ran the kickoff back to the 36 and the\nLonghorns went 64 yards in 10 plays to tie it up. Simms connected with WR B.\nJ. Johnson on the 5-yard TD toss, but the big play was a 27-yarder from Simms\nto TE Bo Scaife on third-and-2 at the Missouri 32. Mangum's kick tied it,\n7-7, with 5:44 left. After the UT defense forced another quick 3-and-out and\ngot a short punt, Simms found Scaife again on the first play for a 28-yard\ngain to the MU 13. A WR reverse by Johnson got 5 yards and Benson got 5 more\nand a first down at the 3 before Simms faked to Benson and hit TE Brock\nEdwards for the final 3 yards and the TD. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 14-7\nlead with 1:50 left. The Tigers stormed down the field in the final two\nminutes, primarily on the running of 5-10, 225-pound Zack Abron, who gained\n37 yards in three carries. His 16-yard tackle-breaking run to the 5 gave the\nTigers a first-and-goal, but his next try gained only a yard and Farmer threw\ntwo incompletions before Brad Hammerich booted a 22-yard field goal to cut\nthe UT lead to 14-10 with 7 seconds left. The Tigers outgained the Longhorns\nin the quarter, 120 to 104 yards and had a 9-5 edge in first downs.\nThird Quarter\nTexas got the ball and again made a long, time-consuming drive, but this time\nit counted because Simms scored from the 1 to cap a 73-yard drive and Mangum\nconverted for  a 21-10 lead with 8:50 left. the Longhorns overcame a\nthird-and-11 early in the drive when Simms scrambled and found Brett Robin\nfor 24 yards. Vasher intercepted Farmer four plays later to give the Horns\ngreat field position at the MU 48. The Longhorns couldn't move, but the pick\nkept Missouri bottled up deep in its own territory throughout the quarter and\nallowed Texas to start its possessions around midfield in a quarter that was\ndominated by defense after Texas' impressive opening drive.  The Tigers made\nonly one first down in the quarter and Texas, after getting five first downs\non that opening TD drive, managed only one more in the entire quarter.\nFourth Quarter\nThe Tigers finally figured out their best offense  was to hand the ball to\nAbron and he bulled for 16, 19, 3 and then 7 more for a TD. Missouri's pass\nfor a 2-point conversion failed and left UT on top, 28-16, with 7:41 left.\nNot to be outdone, Benson shredded the Missouri defense for 11, 20 and then 4\nbefore Simms scrambled left and found  Robin, who scampered the final 25\nyards to complete a 39-yard scoring play. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 35-16\nlead with 4:27 left.\n\nTexas and the BCS\n\nThe next Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings will be a lot different\nfrom the first ones that were announced last week and Texas will be a lot\nhigher than it was in the last one.\nIn the first standings, which were announced last Monday, Texas was ranked\nNo. 6 behind five teams with perfect records. The BCS standings are like golf\nin that the lowest score is the best score.\nOklahoma came in at No. 1 in the first standings at 3.06, followed by\nNebraska at 6.40, UCLA at 8.34, Miami at 12.01, Virginia Tech at 13.88, Texas\nat 15.35 and Michigan at 15.91, to round out the top seven.\nBut a rash of upsets claimed OU, UCLA and Virginia Tech.\nSince OU lost to Nebraska, the Sooners won't tumble far, but Texas should\npass UCLA and VT. Of course, Michigan is so close to Texas that the\nWolverines might pass the Horns if they keep winning.\nUnder the BCS formula, the top four teams in the final standings are\nguaranteed berths in one of the four BCS Bowls, which are the Rose, Orange,\nFiesta and Sugar.\nThe Rose Bowl will get the national title game this year. Right now, that\nlooks like a Nebraska-Miami battle, but both teams have some big games left\nbefore making that date.\nTexas could make it to the Rose Bowl, but it would require some big upsets,\nlike Texas A&M or Texas Tech upsetting Oklahoma, and then Texas beating\nNebraska in the Big 12 title game.\nBut the Longhorns will make it to one of the big BCS bowls if they keep\nwinning.\n\nKey Games for BCS Watchers\n\nIf you want to keep tabs on the Longhorns' chances to wind up in good shape\nin one of the big four BCS bowls, the key is that they have to win their\nfinal three regular season games.\nAssuming that happens, here are some key games to watch for the rest of the\nseason:\nThis Saturday's key games are Michigan at Michigan State, Tennessee at Notre\nDame and UCLA at Washington State.\nThe big ones the following Saturday, Nov. 10, are Texas A&M at Oklahoma and\nUCLA at Oregon.\nOn Nov. 17, Texas Tech hosts Oklahoma, Syracuse is at Miami, Michigan is at\nWisconsin and Virginia Tech is at Virginia.\nOn Thanksgiving weekend, Michigan hosts Ohio State, Nebraska goes to Colorado\nand Oklahoma State plays at Oklahoma.\nThe big games on Dec. 1 are Miami at Virginia Tech, Tennessee at Florida and\nOregon State at at Oregon.\nIf Oklahoma loses to A&M, Tech or OSU and the Longhorns win out, Texas would\nqualify for the Big 12 Championship Game on Dec. 8.\nThe final BCS rankings will be released on December 9, the day after the Big\n12 and Southeastern Conference have their championship games.\nTexas probably will be fourth or fifth in the BCS rankings to be released\ntoday and the games mentioned above will be big determining factors in where\nthe Horns wind up.\n\nJackson, McClintock to Redshirt\n\nIt looks like senior LB Lee Jackson and junior DE O. J. McClintock will\nredshirt.\nBoth have been out with injuries all season and head coach Mack Brown said\nlast week there are no plans to play them.\nHe said Jackson is still having troubles with his toe and his leg. He said\nMcClintock won't play unless the team suffers some injuries at DE.\n\n900 Number Updated Daily\n\nI update my 900 number every day with football and football recruiting news.\nThe number is 1-900-288-8839. It costs $1.59 a minute. You must be 18 or\nolder to call.\n\nCoach's Corner\n\nThe Longhorns, now ranked No. 5 in both polls after a rash of upsets\nSaturday, are playing well, but they need to keep working to get better, head\ncoach Mack Brown said Sunday.\nAfter studying films of the 35-16 victory over Missouri, Brown said he and\nhis assistants were generally pleased with the team's play.\nBut he said the defense will work on hard on tackling this week. \"We weren't\npleased with out tackling,\" Brown said. \"We weren't pleased one back gained\nover 100 yards on us. We've got to get back to work on that.\"\nHe also said the defense did a good job in permitting Missouri to get into\nthe red zone only three times all day \"but they scored all three times.\nThat's not what we want.\"\nThe offense played a pretty good game, he said, adding that tackle Mike\nWiliams \"played great. He's our offensive player of the week.\"\nDefensively, he said the player of the week is CB Quentin Jammer, who held\nthe Tiger's nationally ranked WR Justin Gage to two receptions for 14 yards.\nHe was averaging 7.5 receptions per game and ranked second in the Big 12 in\nthat department.\nBrown also said he is concerned about some aspects of the kicking game. \"We\nkicked two balls out of bounds on kickoffs,\" he said. \"We've got some issues\nthere we've got to correct.\"\nHe said backup LB Reed Boyd, who plays on several of the kicking teams, \"was\nour special teams player of the week.\"\nAsked how he prepares his team for games like the next two, against Baylor\nand Kansas, when the opponents are losing and struggling, he said, \"Baylor\nplayed A&M and Oklahoma tough. Our guys need to play football because they\nlike playing it. If they can't get excited about playing football, they don't\nneed to be playing football at the University of Texas.\"\nHe also said, \"Our guys need to understand that everyone wants to knock them\noff.\"\n\nThe Perfect Christmas Present\nFor Horns Who Have Everything Else: A Gift Subscription to True Orange and/or\nthe E-Mail/Fax\nA subscription to True Orange is the great gift you can give again and again.\nSure beats Christmas shopping, birthday shopping or anniversary shopping.\nThe only thing better is  a gift of  True Orange and the True Orange Fax  -\nand you can give both for just $130 a year ($99 if they take both by e-mail).\n\no  I am enclosing $45 for a gift subscription ($35 e-mail)\no  I am enclosing $130 for a gift subscription to the newsletter and the fax\n($99 e-mail)\n\nName of Recipient\n\nAddress (& fax no., if applicable)\n\nCity, State, Zip\n\nYour Name\n\nAny Message You Want on Card",

With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.\n\nAfter weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.\n\nKen Lay",

The money will be received over the \nnext five years and will support the Harold Price Entrepreneurial Leadership \nProgram, which supports the Entrepreneurs Association and its affiliated \nprograms: the Partners for Entrepreneurial Leadership (PEL), the Berkeley \nSolutions Group, the venture capital internships, and other student programs. \n\n\"The Lester Center and the Haas School are very pleased with the leadership \nand support provided by the Price Institute and its president, Gloria Appel,\" \nsays Jerry Engel, executive director of the Lester Center for \nEntrepreneurship and Innovation. \"The Price Institute has always been \ninterested in our students and the fine entrepreneurial experience we strive \nto create for them.

Two $5,000 Price Institute Fellowship awards, \nadministered by the Lester Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, are \nawarded each year to eligible students interested in an entrepreneurial \ncareer.\n\nThrough the years, the institute has given programmatic funding, which to \ndate totals close to $800,000. The institute has pledged to raise its total \ndonation to more than $1,300,000 by the year 2004.\n\nFounded in 1979 by Harold Price, the Price Institute is nationally known for \nits support and development of entrepreneurship. \n\nKNOWLEDGE AND THE WEB: THE FUTURE OF THE NEW ECONOMY\n Most people doing business today have had to deal with issues of \nintellectual property and knowledge creation--and if that business is on the \nweb, these issues come up at light speed. The Haas School will delve into \nthese issues as part of a larger discussion of knowledge at the upcoming \nFourth Annual Knowledge Forum. \n\nThe conference, \"Creating and Exploiting Knowledge Assets in the \nInternet-enabled Economy,\" will take place at Haas on September 29 in the \nArthur Andersen Auditorium. \n\nThe lineup of distinguished scholars and industry leaders includes Ikujiro \nNonaka, Xerox Distinguished Professor in Knowledge at the Haas School of \nBusiness; Roger Siboni, BS 76, CEO of E.piphany and chair of the Dean's \nAdvisory Board; Sabeer Bhatia, founder of Hotmail and CEO of Arzoo.com; and \nDavid Teece, Mitsubishi Bank Professor of International Business and Finance \nand director of the Institute for Management, Innovation, and Organization.? \n\nJoining Nonaka and Bhatia in the afternoon session on \"Leadership for \nKnowledge Based Innovation\" will be Kei-ichi Enoki of NTT DoCoMo, Japan's \nleading mobile phone company.? In May, Enoki was named one of the 25 leaders \nin e-business by Business Week for his push to create i-mode, a mobile \nnet-access service in Japan that now has 6 million users.? Teece will close \nthe conference by moderating a panel on \"Value Creation in the New Economy.\"\n\nThe forum registration fee is $100 and includes lunch and conference \nmaterials.?

        "body": "Alan,\n\n>>> Day-Ahead & Hour-Ahead Markets\n\n Market separation rules aside, we should resist any mandatory Day-Ahead \nMarket.  The results for day-ahead clearing markets have been bid gaming to \ninfluence price in the day-ahead market.  In PJM and NY-ISO parties submit \nfalse load and generation schedules in set price (most often this is a low \nball load estimate),then later the true load is scheduled.  I think there is \nless of a problem with the hour-ahead market since the opportunity to submit \na false bid to set price and then replace it later is very limited if not \nnonexistent.  \n\n>>> Unbalance Schedules\n\n The general direction we are going for Eastern ISO's is to allow unbalance \nschedules in the real-time market.  Tim indicated a few weeks ago that he \nstill wants this feature.  Normally there would be no imbalance penalties, \nhowever, when reserve margins are so slim that the system's security is in \njeopardy, penalties would be triggered.  The result is that parties can \nchoose to use the real-time market or they can choose bilateral schedules or \na combination.  They are not compelled to do either.  As long as reserves are \nadequate, then why should we care.\n\n>>> Unit Commitment\n\n Although not on your list, I think the primary problems that the Day-Ahead \nMarket is trying to solve is unit commitment.  While this may be the intended \npurpose, it hasn't worked very well.  Centralized unit commitment would \naddress the problem, but then the operator decisions have a large impact on \nprices without having any consequences.  We need a proposal for making sure \nthat resources will be on line and that the operator knows they will be in \nplace.  A possible approach may be as follows (as suggested by Mike Roan):\n\nThe Operator publishes its expected real-time price for the next 48 hours \nbased on information supplied by generators regarding their availability and \nbid price (one part) and the ISO's estimate of hourly loads.  The estimates \nroll forward every hour to that a continuous two day outlook is provided to \nall market participants.  The Operator provides the demand/supply curves to \nthe market so everyone has the same information.\nAs units are committed and load forecast is adjusted, the estimate of \nreal-time prices changes, providing signals for units to use in deciding to \ncommit units.  As expected price rises, more units are committed and price \ngoes down.\nAt a given point in time, such as 4 hours ahead of real-time, the Operator \nlocks units in as committed.  If there are inadequate units committed, it \npays to add capacity (call contracts).  If not enough is voluntarily bid, the \nOperator orders units on under emergency rules contained in \ninterconnection/integration agreements with the generators. \nThe cost of the call contracts or of units ordered on is included in the cost \nof imbalance energy in real-time for the hours for which those costs were \nincurred.\n\nThis procedure is a continuous bid type of approach, which provides signals \nand information to the market.  It or some other procedure like it is needed \nto address the Operators concerns that it will be able to operate the system \nand to deal with the overly conservative tendencies of a not-for-profit ISO.\n\nSteve\n\n \n\n\n\n\tAlan Comnes\n\t03/09/2001 01:10 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: james d steffes@enron, smara@enron.com, jeff.dasovich@enron.com, \nrick.shapiro@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com, mhain@enron.com, \nsteve.walton@enron.com\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: CAISO Market Stabilization Plant\n\nHere are some initial reactions and questions to the CAISO market \nstabilization plan, which is attached.\n\nGive me or Sue Mara your comments and then we can turn it into message points \nfor  media / advocacy folks.\n\nIn addition to reviewing the plan, I listened in to part of a stakeholder \ncall that occured Friday 10 a.m. PST.\n\nDRAFT MESSAGE POINTS:\n\nWith limited exceptions, the plan does nothing to increase supply or decrease \ndemand.  It primarily addresses costs and market \"stability\"\n\nINTERESTING QUOTES:\n \n\"Over the edge into cost based regulation\" Duke Power\n\nAlthough the plan provides for cost control and for improving market \n\"stability\" (whatever that means), the ISO staffer (Byron Wortz) who \npresented the study admitted it \"Will do nothing to increase supply this \nsummer\"\n\nA staffer, Lorenzo,  stated (paraphrased)\" all out of state suppliers are \ncost of service based and do not need to recieve market based rates\n\nON SPECIFICS\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nResource-specific cost based bid caps (RSBC or bid caps):  cost of service \nregulation that disincent supply\nThe ISO will hold in-state resources hostage--cuts any exports when reserves \nfall below a stated critera\n\nImports can only participate as price takers.  Thus if the highest-cost \nin-state resource is below the opportunity cost of power, needed imports will \nnot come in:\n >>this will decrease supply!!\n >> Staffer stated ISO hopes to sign \"longer term deals\" if necessary to \nsecure out-of-state power but acknowledged the proposal needs more work.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe ISO is considering pay as bid, which is complex and does not increase \nsupply.  However, on the call they said they are leaing to a single price \nauction.  However, with bid caps the market will still be distorted.\n\nThe Good?:\n\nThe ISO wll implement an hourly day-ahead and hour-ahead market, essentially \nfilling  a void created by the PX's demise.\n >>( Enron has strongly advocated market seperation in the past but do we \nwant to consider supporting a day ahead market?)\n\nMarket separation rules (MSR).  ISO is leaning towards option 2 in which SCs \nsubmit bundled schedules but that market seperation would be suspended after \ncongestion process is conducted; i.e., final schedules may be imbalanced.\n >>What do we think of this?\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Through \nmy calls the past week, I've been trying to update you so we can determine \nhow best to coordinate the Enron Europe work, as well as get an understanding \nof what resources you can supply for this global initiative.\n\nMy next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to \ndetermine their skill set and what locations/commodities they'd be best to \nwork on.\n\nI'll send you an updated schedule once I've finalized this.\n\nThanks\n\nShona\n\n\n\n\n\nMike Jordan@ECT\n10/11/2000 09:37 AM\nTo: Shawn Kilchrist/NA/Enron@Enron, Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron\ncc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses - an \ninternal approach to internal audit\n\nShawn / Shona\n\nWe have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to \ntake a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is (we will need \nto do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely):-\n\nAims\nAccountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support \nteams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams.\nA culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive \non-going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking.\nAny independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully \nleverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused \nby it\nAll elements of implementing, completing and reviewing internal control \nshould generate defined output\nWe focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and \norigination controls (we have defined the control structure for trading \noffices, agency offices and origination offices and we must police our \nlabelling for each office)\nThe output from Enron's perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be \ndiscussed at control/governance meetings (eg at Sally/Ted/Fernley's level and \nat the audit committee level) - the important issue here is that every list \nmust be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have \ndifferent amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior/experienced \nstaff \nThe output from AA's perspective is their internal controls audit opinion \nbased upon our database and our review and management process of it\n\nTrading Process - monthly\nRoutine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction \ncycle - rating made by business controller is red, amber, green - with trend \nindicator of static, improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full \nlisting\nMonthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see \nattachment 1 (you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment \n2 - and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not \nsolely drive the judgement within the self assessment) - Shona, this is the \nwork that Mike Moscoso is leading\nPeriodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss \noperational risk and areas of concern (red and amber) with agreement of \naction plans for such areas\nMonthly review by controller/senior controller of database where all high \n(red) and medium (amber) risk issues are recorded.  Milestones for action \nplans revisited, reconfirmed or amended\nMonthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if \nthe risk rating for any remote offices has changed\nAll new information on issues raised by self assessment, doorstep review or \nBRM completion populated into database\nDatabase utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and \ndecision on whether original BRM and doorstep plans require amendment\n\nProcess - Yearly Planning\nCheckpoint taken of\ncurrent operational environment (say end Oct)\nproposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in \noffice, and\nIT development plans for next year\nPrioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what \ndepth does report need to go to.  Note the doorstep review would be an end to \nend review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review \nof the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the \nreview effort on areas of concern, the actions plans in place and concluding \non the 'mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level'\nPrioritisation made for BRM - which functions, NOT BUSINESS UNITS, require \nexternal independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and \ndoorstep processes (could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal \ngovernance process?) - most likely reviews completed on functions that \nassessed as concerns across multiple business - such as FX exposure \nmanagement, cash management, credit exposure management, IT change management \ncontrols/process\n\nWhere are we NOW - if we all thought to do this immediately\n\nWe do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - I \nam suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the Houston \noffsite do this? 23rd Oct\nThe above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as \nsenior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week Oct\nWe agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the BRM and Doorstep \ndatabases - November\nGiven AA have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate \nthe database from scratch - November\nReview Doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and \nremote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to \nvisit all? - November\nReview all of the above and blend into risk based approach for BRM planning - \nend November to end December !!\n\nWow - lets chat about this\n\nMike\n\nAttachment 1\n\n\n\n\nAttachment 2 - the areas where a judgement should be proactively made by each \nbusiness unit controller -\n\nBusiness oversight\nSystem development project and change management\nPeople management - coaching and skills/headcount gaps\nModel Review\nStress testing and business risk identification\nOperational capacity assessment signoff\nError management\n\nControl Cycle\nRisk Management Control\nRecognition of risk origination\nMonitoring of trading activities - limit checking, trader mandates\nSpecific transaction analysis - DASH, CACS etc\nTransaction capture - deal form analysis and risk management system input\nLogistics support - delivery position analysis, incoming and outgoing invoice \nmaintenance, post deal execution contract management\nPortfolio edits - required amendments to previously transacted risk/contracts\nMarket risk/position signoff - both transaction specific and portfolio \nmanagement\nDPR production and signoff\nLimit excession reporting\nMarket risk feeds to GRMS - review VAR applicability (backtesting?)\nCredit risk review - liaison with RAC over provisioning for credit charges\nPrice input checking and verification\nReserving and income recognition issues\nWeekly Executive Summary\nMonthly Revenue Summary\n\nDocumentation\nDocumentation generation\nRe-review of contract loading in risk management system\nAffirmation chasing\nBroker information reconciliation\n\nTrade Accounting\nGeneral Ledger account ownership\nBalance sheet to CPR reconciliation\nAccounts receivable maintenance/monitoring\nAccounts payable maintenance/monitoring\nMonthly management accounts by profit centre/business segment\nInter company/inter entity reconciliation differences\nLegal entity balance sheet analysis for Fin Ops\n\nSettlements\nOutgoing invoice generation\nIncoming invoice reconciliation\nExchange statements reconciliation\nOTC brokerage charges reconciliation and processing\nNostro reconciliations\nCash management liaison\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "Here is the explaination on \"exit fees\" for direct access under SB 27X.\n\nAll parties, including the ESPs and large customers, agree that any party\nwho takes power from DWR after Jan 17, 2001, has received a subsidy as a\nresult of the operation of the frozen rates still in effect ( plus the\nemergency penny/kWh surchage).  These customers will have to pay this\nsubsidy back in the form of retiring the revenue bonds which will be floated\nto pay off the DWR power purchase costs.  If a customer were to elect direct\naccess during the bond repayment period (or anytime after 1-17-01), they\ncould potentially escape their fair share of the these costs, and would have\nreceived the subsidized, lower cost electricity without paying the full cost\nof that power.  To prevent this, the draft of SB 27X proposed by the direct\naccess coalition says that all customers electing direct access will be\nresponsible for any undercollection for DWR power costs related to the time\nwhen they were served by DWR, until the date they stopped taking such\nservice, after which they have no more obligation to pay for DWR purchases.\nThis is subsection (d) of the coalition draft.\n\nThe second form of exit fee is that related to the actual DWR contracts for\npower.  It is this charge (to make DWR whole for higher contract costs when\nload leaves stranded capacity under contracts of a year or longer) which\nwill be waived during the period of \"open enrollment\" or \"free switching\" to\ndirect access.  There will be no exit fee during an initial open enrollment\nperiod (date to be determined, we are asking for 10-1-01) and during all\ntimes when the total long term generation portfolio assembled by DWR and the\nutilities: retained generation, QF contracts, and long term (>1 yr.) DWR\npurchases is less than the total load on the utility system, including load\ngrowth.  Then customers can switch to direct access without this second exit\nfee until the total load is reduced to match the long term portfolio. All\nswitches are first-come, first-served.\n\nOnce that equilibrium is reached any additional customers who want to elect\ndirect access may do so, but have to pay a fee equal to the net unmitigated\ncost incurred by DWR as a result of losing that customer's load.  Once DWR\ncontracts expire, creating more \"headroom\" then customers can once again\nswitch without an exit fee.\n\nI hope this clarifies what we are proposing.  Bear in mind the DWR and Dept\nof Finance may well seek substantial changes in this language.  Thanks, Mike\nDay\n\n\n\n <<sbx 27 amendments 3-7-01.doc>>\n\n - sbx 27 amendments 3-7-01.doc",

        "body": "Part 3 of 3\r\n\r\nOffensive Line Coach Interview\r\n\r\nOffensive line coach Tim Nunez says he went into spring football with twin\r\ngoals of developing better run blockers and finding a left tackle to replac=\r\ne\r\nAll-American Leonard Davis, who was the second player chosen in the first\r\nround of the NFL draft Saturday.\r\nIn an interview last week, he told me he is pleased about the progress his\r\nplayers made in both areas.\r\nHe said right tackle Mike Williams and right guard Derrick Dockery were\r\noutstanding this spring in every area, including run blocking.\r\n\"Mike Williams had a great spring,\" Nunez said. \"He had as good a spring as\r\nany offensive linemen has had since we've been here. He's really light on h=\r\nis\r\nfeet for such a big man, and that helps him, whether he's pass blocking or\r\nrun blocking.\r\n\"Derrick Dockery finally was healthy this spring,\" he said. \"That infection\r\nhe had last season really sapped his strength all season. He fought through\r\nit and played as hard as he could, but this spring he was flying around and\r\ndoing things he couldn't do last year. He was just a different guy this\r\nspring and he really did a good job. He and Mike really gave us a strong\r\nright side this spring.\"\r\nHe said center Matt Anderson \"played well this spring. He's a steady hand i=\r\nn\r\nthere.\" He also said backup Jason Glynn \"had a very good spring. He is real=\r\nly\r\nathletic. We just need to get him some snaps.\"\r\nJunior Robbie Doane started at left tackle all spring and Nunez said, \"I\r\nthink Robbie Doane is going to be a good football player for us. He needs t=\r\no\r\nhave a great summer and get stronger in his upper body. He really wants to =\r\nbe\r\na good player and he'll work hard this summer to get there.\"\r\nHe said Doane \"has great technique. He really knows what to do. He's just g=\r\not\r\nto get strong enough to do it on a consistent basis.\"\r\nNunez said one reason Doane might not have been an obvious standout during\r\nthe spring \"was that he was going against a great player. (Defensive end)\r\nKalen Thornton is as hard to block as anybody he'll see during the season.\r\nHe's special.\"\r\nBut the Longhorns also have some other options at left tackle. Blinn Junior\r\nCollege star Alfio Randall has passed the JC exit exam and is on schedule t=\r\no\r\ngraduate in time to join the team in August, and Dockery also worked some a=\r\nt\r\nleft tackle in the spring and did very well, Nunez said.\r\nTwo top guards missed the spring. Senior Antwan Kirk-Hughes, a two year\r\nstarter, was recovering from shoulder surgery and sophomore Tillman Hollowa=\r\ny\r\nsprained a knee early in the spring and missed the remainder of the drills.\r\nWhen they return, Nunez said it will make it easier to move Dockery to tack=\r\nle\r\nif the need arises. He said both of them should be totally recovered in\r\nplenty of time for the season.\r\nHow about depth at guard if Dockery moves to tackle?\r\n\"Bo Baker had a good spring at guard,\" he said. \"We'll continue to work him\r\nsome at center, but he gives us another good guard. He's really fast. If we\r\nhad a race, he would be the fastest of the offensive linemen.\"\r\nNunez said players like Williams, Dockery and Kirk-Hughes have had to play\r\nearlier than they should have, since none of them redshirted, but he said\r\nthose painful early learning experiences should pay off this year.\r\n\"Mike Williams really improved during last season,\" Nunez said. \"He was\r\nplaying really well by the end of the season, and he carried that over into\r\nthis spring.\"\r\nHe said Kirk-Hughes' shoulder and Dockery's infection hampered their play\r\nlast season, but he said they played as hard as they could and should be mu=\r\nch\r\nbetter this season because of their experiences last season.\r\nDockery made great strides this spring, he said, adding that he expects\r\nKirk-Hughes to again be one of the team's top linemen when he returns with\r\nhis surgically-repaired shoulder.\r\nHolloway started several games as a redshirt freshman last year due to\r\nDockery's health problems, and Nunez said he \"had to grow up during the\r\nseason. It's tough to start as a redshirt freshman offensive lineman in thi=\r\ns\r\nleague, but he worked through it and he was just playing so much better by\r\nthe end of the season.\"\r\n\"I'm excited about this group,\" Nunez said. \"They've worked hard to get\r\nbetter and I think they have a chance to be a really strong group this seas=\r\non\r\nif they can stay healthy.\"\r\nHead coach Mack Brown said at the end of spring practice the Longhorns were\r\nrunning the ball better than they have the last two seasons. Since he also\r\nsays he isn't that happy with any of the tailbacks, he obviously feels the\r\nline is doing a better job of run blocking.\r\n\"We worked on it more this spring,\" Nunez said, \"and I think that will pay\r\noff this season.\"\r\nOne thing that needs to be noted is that the perennial powerhouse teams\r\nusually don't start offensive linemen until they are redshirt juniors, whic=\r\nh\r\nmeans they are in their fourth year.\r\nExceptional linemen can start earlier, but even they usually spend two year=\r\ns\r\nbacking up before starting in their third year.\r\nThis coaching staff inherited some talent when it took over, but other than=\r\n a\r\ntalented bunch of seniors, the offensive line talent was pretty bare.\r\nEven first-round draft choice Davis spent his first year on defense before\r\nthe new staff switched him to the offensive line.\r\nTexas should be able to begin redshirting most of its offensive linemen thi=\r\ns\r\nseason, but the coaches haven't had that luxury until now.\r\nWhy? Because, despite their great overall recruiting success, they have bee=\r\nn\r\nable to sign only three offensive linemen each year until they hit the\r\njackpot with six in their last recruiting class.\r\n\r\nKelly Named Basketball MVP\r\n\r\nSenior shooting guard Darren Kelly was chosen the Texas basketball team's\r\nMost Valuable Player by his teammates to highlight the team's banquet.\r\nKelly, who earned USBWA All-District 7 and NABC/Chevrolet All-District 9\r\nsecond-team honors and third-team All-Big 12 Conference mention, led the te=\r\nam\r\nin assists (76) and minutes (34.6 mpg) and ranked second in scoring (15.3\r\nppg) and fourth inrebounding (4.6 rpg) and steals (32).\r\nFreshman center Brian Boddicker won the Most Improved Player award.  A Big =\r\n12\r\nAll-Freshman team selection, Boddicker averaged 5.7 points and 3.9 rebounds\r\nin 19.6 minutes per contest.\r\nSenior walk-on guard Yair Harari was named the winner of the Jack Gray Awar=\r\nd,\r\npresented in recognition of outstanding character, citizenship, academic\r\nachievement and contributions reflective of the Texas basketball program.\r\nOther awards and their winners:\r\nSenior Awards - Harari, Kelly, Chris McColpin\r\nEarlene Fulmer 3-Point Attack Award - Maurice Evans\r\nLaSalle Thompson Rebounding Award - Chris Owens\r\nJim Krivacs Free Throw Percentage Award - Kelly\r\nJohnny Moore Assists Award - Kelly\r\nCoaches Award for Most Blocked Shots - Owens\r\nCoaches Award for Most Charges Taken - Fredie Williams\r\nCoaches Award for Top Screener - Boddicker\r\nSpirit Award    - Drew Gressett\r\nOutstanding Defensive Player - Williams\r\nHustlin' Horns Award - Gressett, James Thomas, Brandon Mouton, Royal Ivey,\r\nBoddicker, Jason Klotz\r\nJay Arnette Coaches Award - William Wyatt\r\nCoca-Cola Solid Citizen Award - Ivey, Klotz, Thomas.\r\nBasketball Aide Moves Up\r\nRob Lanier, 32, the Longhorns' top assistant basketball coach and lead\r\nrecruiter for the last two years, was named head coach at Siena College in\r\nLoudonville, N.Y., last week\r\nUT head coach Rick Barnes  said he will  try to hire a new assistant soon,\r\nadding that he plans to hire another bright young coach who is on his way u=\r\np\r\nthe coaching ladder.\r\nSix of Barnes' former assistants have become college head coaches and that =\r\nis\r\nbecause he always hires a bright, young assistant on the way up who also\r\nhappens to be an outstanding recruiter.\r\nLanier recruited several outstanding prospects for the Longhorns, including\r\nmost of last season's top freshmen and incoming point guard recruit T. J.\r\nFord.\r\n\r\nA True Orange Subscription Is\r\nThe Gift You Can Give Every\r\nYear to Your Longhorn Friends\r\nA subscription to True Orange is the perfect gift for any occasion for a\r\nLonghorn who has everything else.

Every effort should \nbe made to continue to provide high quality legal work that has become \nstandard at ENA.\n\n 1.  A written estimate of proposed fees and expenses and a written \ndescription of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.  The \nresponsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve \nsuch written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide \nsubstantial professional services.\n\n 2.  Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised \nwritten estimate if such outside counsel determines that legal fees and \nexpenses for such transaction will exceed the previous written estimate by \n$25,000.00.  Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by \nthe responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee \nbefore our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional \nprofessional services. \n\n 3.  In order to accurately track such expenses so that the expenses can be \nproperly allocated to the various business units, a work order number should \nbe obtained for each transaction.  \n\n Thank you for your cooperation.

        "body": "Part 2 of 3 Parts\n\nBig Recruiting Push Will Start at June Summer Camps\n\nThe Longhorns are being very selective in making offers to recruits so far\nthis spring, but that will change next month when they host some of the top\nblue chippers at their summer camps.\nThe Aggies have two commitments to the Longhorns' one pledge from my 25 man\n\"difference-maker\" list on page 4, but that will all change in June.\nCoach Mack Brown is the one who invented early recruiting in Texas, and he\ndid it through his June camps.\nThat hasn't changed. The only thing that has changed is that the Aggies went\nout in March and April and gave offers to about 30 kids.\nThere's nothing wrong with that, and I am not knocking their strategy.\nBut Brown's strategy works and there is no reason for him to change it. If\nyou look at the last three February signing days, you'll know why he doesn't\nneed to change it.\nMeanwhile, the Horns got one offensive lineman they wanted when they got a\npledge from terrific run blocker Bret Valdez of Brownwood.\nThe Aggies got commitments last week from center Bob Morton of McKinney, the\nguy I have rated as the best offensive lineman in the state, and L'Tydrick\nRiley of Crockett, the top recruit in the state in the \"athlete\" category.\nTexas probably would have offered Riley a scholarship at some point if he had\nnot committed to A&M, but the Longhorn coaches did not recruit Morton as hard\nas they are recruiting several other offensive linemen in the state.\nI think when the dust settles in February the Longhorns will have another\ngreat class signed and ready for delivery.\nThey got 10 commitments last June en route to a national top five recruiting\nclass, and they probably will have close to that number at the end of June\nthis year.\nMost of those commitments last June were from big offensive linemen who were\njust what the Longhorns needed.\nSeveral of them this June could be from big defensive linemen, and that's\nwhere the Longhorns need to load up this season.\nDT Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale, Arizona, younger brother of current UT LB\nAustin Sendlein and son of former UT and pro LB Robin Sendlein, told me he\nprobably will commit to Texas when he attends the Longhorns' early June camp.\nHe is the top recruit in Arizona and is being heavily recruited by top\nschools all over the country.\nDT Earl Anderson of San Marcos also plans to attend a UT camp next month and\nhe is another possibility for an early commitment. In a year when the state\nis loaded with top defensive line prospect, he is a star among stars.\nThe best DT of them all, however, is Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings. He\nprobably won't commit early, but he likes the Longhorns.\nWright is a 300-pounder with outstanding quickness, and he does the best job\nof staying low and collapsing the line of scrimmage of anyone I have seen in\nthe nation.\nIf Texas can sign Wright, Anderson, Sendlein and Kasey Studdard of Highlands\nRanch, Colo., they will be set at defensive tackle, and they have the inside\ntrack with all four of them.\nStuddard is the son of former UT and Denver Bronco offensive line star David\nStuddard.\nAnderson, like Keller DT Tully Janszen, is a super quick starter who could\nplay end or tackle in college.\nAt DE, the top guy in Texas is Travis Leitko of The Woodlands. He is a super\nstudent who is pretty wide open, but he likes the Longhorns and he also is\nfriends with redshirt freshman QB Chance Mock and incoming freshman WR-DB\nBrian Carter, two Longhorns who are former Woodlands' stars.\nChase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel, brother of Cole Pittman, who was\nexpected to contend for a starting job at DT with Texas this year before\nbeing killed in a tragic auto accident, also is an outstanding DE prospect\nwho is, like Leitko, very quick and very physical. He is strongly considering\nTexas.\nThe coaches also want a super quick DE, and their best hope in Texas might be\nNick Owino of Alief Elsik. They also are trying to get in on Zack Latimer,\nwho led Colorado in sacks last year with 24 at Aurora Gateway. But Latimer is\nAll-State in both football and basketball, and could opt for the latter in\ncollege.\nOwino and Latimer are the kind of outside speed rushing defensive ends the\nLonghorn coaches have been seeking since they arrived at Texas.\n* * * *\nThe two fastest junior football players in the state are also two of the best\nones. And that's no coincidence because you can't tackle something you can't\ncatch.\nRB DaBryan Blanton of Forney broke the sprint records in Class 3A with a\nsmoking 20.37 in the 200 meters and a 10.3 in the 100 meters.\nNot since the days of Roy Martin a quarter century ago have I seen a high\nschool sprinter run a 200 meters like that.\nThe times at the state meet are all fully automatic, which makes them\nofficially .24 seconds slower than hand times. In the old hand-timed days, he\nwould have had a 20.13.\nHe also anchored Forney's 400-meter relay team to victory in 41.1.\nBlanton is an outstanding running back, but he probably will be a wide\nreceiver or defensive back in college. He is pretty wide open on his college\nchoices, but he is considering Texas.\nCB Edorian McCullough of North Garland won thge 5A 100 in 10.32, finished\nsecond in the 200 in 21 flat and anchored his team's 400-meter relay team to\nsecond place, making up a lot of ground to pull from fourth to second.\nMcCullough was undefeated in the 100 meters this year. He is a top RB-CB\nprospect who favors Texas over Oklahoma.\n* * * *\nThe talent level in Texas this year is very high. About 20 Texas players have\nbeen listed on one or more national 100 groupings, and there are some other\noutstanding players who are equally talented, but who are not as well known\nyet.\nOne interesting factor this year is geography. In most year, the Houston area\nhas most of the really elite prospects.\nHouston is very strong at the top again, with the top two and three of the\ntop five players on my \"difference-maker\" list on page 4.\nBut the Dallas-Fort Worth area runs deeper in talent this year than the\nHouston-Gulf Coast area, with a 10-6 edge on my list of the top 25.\nThe other nine players on the list include four from East Texas, three from\nWest Texas and two from the Austin area.\nThe talent runs very deep at defensive tackle and defensive end this year for\nthe first time since Brown and his staff arrived in Austin.\nThere also are some big linebackers, like Glenn Jackson of Carrollton Turner,\nwho are big-framed guys who already weigh 200 and might grow into 250-pound\ndefensive ends in college.\nJackson runs a 4.6 and is an outstanding pass rusher from the corner.\nThere also is a lot of talent at quarterback, and if a school misses on a top\nsignal caller in this recruiting class, there are a pair of kids who will be\njuniors this season who already have college recruiters salivating.\nThey are James Battle, 6-2, 190, 4.6, who ran Recruiting . . (continued from\npage 5)\nand passed a Denton Ryan team that was 1-9 in 1999 deep into the Class 4A\nplayoffs last year, and Devon Williams, 6-3, 185, 4.5, of Arlington Houston,\na quick-footed runner with a powerful arm.\nBoth will be top national recruits next year.\nThe Longhorns also want to sign a great running back every year and, while\nthe class of running backs doesn't run very deep, Albert Hardy of Galena Park\nis a power runner deluxe with fine speed, and he likes the Longhorns.\nThere are some very good wide receivers in Texas this year, but the best one\nI have seen on tape is Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Ill. If he played in\nTexas, he would be high in my top 25 and would be easily the No. 1 wide\nreceiver.\nHe likes the Longhorns, and super UT recruiter Tim Brewster was in Champaign\nlast week to visit his high school. He only lives three blocks from the\nIllinois campus, so let's hope he has a yen to travel.\nHe is a big, physical receiver who has speed, moves and great hands.\nThere is one receiver in Texas I haven't seen play, but I have heard good\nthings about him and I saw him run a fine leg on Klein Forest's third-place\n1,600-meter relay team at the state meet.\nHe is Anthony Wright, another big guy with speed who has a reputation for\nbeing physical. I plan to see him play in early September and might move him\nup on the list after that.\nTexas needs to sign a tight end, too, and it will be an uphill fight to land\nEric Winston of Midland Lee, who is easily the top one in the state. He comes\nfrom an Aggie family, but says he will consider Texas, too.\n\nHorns 3rd in Baseball, Play Ags\n\nTexas wound up third in the Big 12 baseball race and will play No. 6-seed\nTexas A&M Wednesday at 10 a.m. in Oklahoma City in the first round of the\nconference tournament.\nTexas finished 19-11 in the Big 12 and 34-22 overall. The Aggies were 15-15\nin conference play and 30-26 overall.\nThe Longhorns beat the Aggies twice in Austin and lost to them once in\nCollege Station during the regular season.\nThe winner of the UT-A&M game will play the winner of a game between No. 2\nTexas Tech and No. 7 Oklahoma at 5 p.m. Thursday in a game that will be\ntelevised by College Sports Southwest.\nThe loser of the UT-A&M will play the loser of the Tech-OU game at 10 a.m.\nThursday in an elimination game.\nThe third-place finish was the Longhorns' highest placing in the five years\nof the Big 12's existence.\nJunior outfielder Matt Rosenberg of Grand Junction, Colo., made the Verizon\nAcademic All-District VI Baseball team for the second straight year. To make\nthe team, a player must have at least a 3.2 cumulative GPA.     ",

Box 26530, Austin, Texas 78755 -\nPhone\n512-795-8536\n\nHorns Favored by 19, but Brown Predicts Close Game Saturday\n\nThe Longhorns are 19 points over Oklahoma State Saturday in their Big 12\nConference opener that will kick off at 11 a.m. and will be televised over\nmuch of the nation by ABC, but coach Mack Brown said Wednesday he expects a\nclose game that won't be decided until the fourth quarter.\nHe said Oklahoma State has the best defense Texas has faced this year, and\nhe\nsaid 230-pound RB Reggie White, who is averaging 127 yards per game\nrushing,\n\"is the best running back we've seen.\"\nWith All-Big 12 DT Shaun Rogers likely to miss the game with a sprained\nankle\nand freshman backup Stevie Lee out for about six weeks with a broken bone\nin\nhis foot that required surgery and the insertion of a pin, Brown said the\nLonghorns don't have much depth at defensive tackle.\nHe said sophomore Cole Pittman, a former tackle who was starting at end,\nhas\nbeen moved back to tackle. Redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs, who played well\nagainst Houston after Rogers was injured, will start alongside All-American\nCasey Hampton, with Pittman and little-used junior Miguel McKay as the\nbackups.\nI asked Brown if Lee might get a medical redshirt, since he was hurt so\nearly\nin the season, and he said Lee is eligible for one if he isn't able to play\nagain this season. If he gets a medical redshirt, he would be a freshman in\neligibility again next year.\nFor those of you who are curious about what it takes to get a medical\nredshirt, Brown said a player is eligible for a medical redshirt if he\nincurs\na season-ending injury before the fourth game if he has played in less than\n20% of the plays. Lee was injured in the second game and, as a backup\ntackle,\nhad not played in 20% of the plays. Brown said if  Lee does recover in time\nto play late this season, he would not be eligible for a medical redshirt.\nBrown said the Longhorn defense, which was outstanding in Saturday's 48-0\nrout of Houston, had an average day in practice Tuesday, \"but they played\nbetter today.\"\nHe said he has told the defense \"that they need to understand Reggie White\nis\nthe best running back we've seen this year, and, with Stevie Lee out and\nwe're not sure about Shaun Rogers, it really hurts our depth.\"\nBrown said the team goal is to \"get 100 rushing yards and hold them under\n100\nyards rushing.\"\nDefensive coordinator Carl Reese said Kalen Thornton will start at DE in\nplace of Pittman. Thornton will be the first true freshman to start for the\nLonghorns this season.\nReese also was asked if Tubbs, who had two sacks against Houston in his\nfirst\nextended action, is better as a pass rusher than as a run defender. \"He's\nabout the same guy in there,\" Reese said. \"He's a big guy with good\nathletic\nability and he played at a high level against Houston. We need to him to\nplay\nat the same high level Saturday.\"\nBecause of OSU's running ability, Reese also said his strong-side\nlinebackers, Tyrone Jones and Marcus Wilkins, will get to play a lot more\nSaturday than they have been playing. Reese pulls his strong backers and\nplays an extra defensive back against passing teams, but he said the strong\nbackers \"might get to play as much as 70% of the time Saturday.\"\nOf course, Cowboy QB Tony Lindsay is dangerous running and throwing, and,\nif\nhe gets hot through the air, that could change Reese's plans.\n* * * *\nRECRUITING NOTES: QB Brent Rawls, 6-5, 195, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel, is\ntaking his official visit to Texas this weekend and his parents are coming,\ntoo. Rawls, the top QB in Louisiana, went to Purdue last weekend, and he\nplans to visit Florida State the Oct. 14 weekend. He also is interested in\nClemson, Arkansas and LSU.\n* * * *\nBASEBALL RECRUITING: The Longhorn baseball team  got a commitment Tuesday\nfrom catcher Curtis Thigpen, 5-11, 175, of Forney. He hit .515 as a junior\nand is an outstanding defensive catcher. He also had offers from Alabama,\nBaylor and Texas A&M.\n* * * *\nMy next fax/e-mail will be whenever events warrant.\n* * * *\nThe True Orange Fax Service includes  at  least  99 faxes  a year and costs\n$99 ($79 by E-Mail).

        "body": "Dear SVMG Members:\n\nAs you may know, the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group Board of Directors\nmet this morning and voted to support two Energy proposals: The Los Esteros\nTransmission Facility and the Metcalf Energy Center.\n\nPlease find below the news release on SVMG's position, and an attachment\nthat reviews SVMG's criteria and evaluation for both projects.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCarl Guardino\n\nLocal proposals part of a comprehensive platform to meet energy needs of\nSilicon Valley working families and economy\n\nFor Immediate Release:         Contact: Michelle Montague-Bruno\nMarch 8, 2001             (408) 501-7853\n\nThis morning the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group Board of Directors voted\nin support of the proposed Metcalf Energy Center and the Los Esteros\nTransmission Project to help meet Silicon Valley's need for reliable energy.\nCompleting a thoughtful and deliberative process the SVMG board of directors\nvoted to support the generating facility, which would offer 580 megawatts of\nnew power supply to Silicon Valley and provide enough power to service\napproximately 580,000 households.  Additionally, the Los Esteros\nTransmission Project, proposed for north San Jose, provides another 800\nmegawatts of new transmission capacity that will help bring power into the\nregion - an issue that caused blackouts here on June 14, 2000.\n\"The Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group has always been a very analytical\norganization,\" said Dr. James Woody, president & CEO of Roche\nPharmaceuticals and chairman of the board of SVMG.  \"With the energy\ninfrastructure projects we developed an analytical process, and a systematic\nreview of the Metcalf and Los Esteros proposals, recommending approval after\nthoughtful consideration.\"\nThis deliberative process included the development of criteria (see\nattachment) utilized by five separate working bodies in the organization\n(three SVMG committees, its Working Council and the Board of Directors) to\nevaluate the projects and determine a position.  The organization does not\nsupport these two facilities as an exclusive means to fulfilling the energy\nneeds of Silicon Valley families and employers, and believes our energy\nchallenge requires the individual efforts of every Californian.\n\"The Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group board completed a very thoughtful\nand deliberative process that supports the generation and transmission of\npower in our back yard,\" said Carl Guardino, president & CEO of the Silicon\nValley Manufacturing Group.  \"The criteria are a prism through which the\norganization assesses energy infrastructure proposals.  It was agreed that\nthe Metcalf and Los Esteros projects would provide much needed energy to\nsupport working families, and the economy of Silicon Valley.\"\nAttached are the criteria utilized by the SVMG Energy Committee, SVMG Land\nUse Committee, SVMG Environment Committee, SVMG Working Council and the SVMG\nBoard of Directors to review the energy projects.\nSolving California's energy challenges is going to require steps beyond the\ndevelopment of the Metcalf and Los Esteros facilities, and must include\nadditional generation and transmission projects throughout the region and\nstate.  However, an immediate solution to help get us through the summer and\nbeyond is for more energy conservation at the office and at home.  The\nE-Energy Conservation Campaign ('E' stands for email), launched on February\n7, between SVMG and Governor Davis' cabinet secretary for technology, trade\nand commerce, Lon Hatamiya, is reaching out to more than four million public\nand private employees to provide tips on ways to conserve power and save\nmoney at home and at the office.  For more information on the E-Energy\nConservation Campaign, visit the SVMG Web site at www.svmg.org, and click on\nthe icon for the campaign.\n\nExpressing the need for a diverse portfolio of solutions in addressing the\nenergy crisis, Carl Guardino will discuss everything from conservation to\ngeneration at the upcoming Energy Summit on March 16, and co-sponsored by\nSan Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors and\nthe Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group.\n\"I am proud and honored to stand with Mayor Gonzales and Supervisor Jim\nBeall to co-chair an event that will look for regional solutions to help\nsolve the issue,\" said Guardino. \"We support the mayor's plan for\nalleviating our energy problems, and believe that a comprehensive approach\nmust be implemented to survive this crisis.  No matter how one feels about\nspecific energy projects, there is no single solution, and we need a menu of\noptions, including conservation, co-generation, onsite generation,\ntransmission and major generating facilities.\"\nAttachment:  SVMG criteria to review generation and transmission proposals,\nand how the Metcalf Energy Center and the Los Esteros Transmission project\nweigh up to those criteria.\n\n - criteria MEC & Los esteros.doc",

At any rate, Mr. Fletcher, the art dealer turned nutritionist, did\nearn the moniker `The Great Masticator,' for his popular book at the time\nand got his name into the dictionary.

I know that we are catching you before a tee time on Monday, so I \nespecially appreciate your joining us to kick off the event that morning.  \nDress for the forum is casual, so feel free to do the same.  There will be \napproximately 30 Enron business controllers present at the meeting.  All have \nresponsibility for mid and back office operations for the following Enron \nentities:  Enron North America, Enron Europe, Enron South America, Enron \nGlobal Markets, Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Broadband Services and Enron \nEnergy Services.  Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, \nSydney, London and New York (metals business).   \n\nAttached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes \nbefore the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to \nbe covered and the other speakers who will address the group.  \n\n\nYou are scheduled to address the group as follows:\n\nDate:  Monday, October 23, 2000\nTime:  8:00 am\n  (breakfast will be served at 7:30 and you are invited to join us)\nPlace:  The Warwick Hotel\n  The Versailles Room - 12th Floor \n  5701 Main Street\n  Houston,  TX  77005\n\nWith a small group, your talk can be informal and you do not need to prepare \nslides (unless you would like to do so).  Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key \nspeaking points that would enforce the value of this conference for this \ngroup would be:\n\nrecognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in \n2000 \nyour support for global standards for operational controls for trading \nactivities\nyour recognition of the value of operational professionals in the \norganization to ensure integrity of mid and back office functions  \nyour challenge to the group to strive for best in class processes and \ncontrols as Enron's growth as a trading organization continues\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and thanks again for joining us.  \n\n        ",

The incentive these customers \nnow have to participate in DA and thereby remove burden from DWR is removed.\n\nCreates incentives to increase usage and decrease conservation, exactly at \nthe time that just the opposite effect is desired.  Rate at frozen level \nremoves all price signal effect in unregulated market.\n\nThese are customers who under existing law already have had choice, as an \nalternative to paying market price,  of 1) voluntarily opting in to a one \nyear 6.5 cent rate freeze, with a true-up, or 2) buying commodity and risk \nmanagement products in the competitive market, as many of them have already \ndone, and 3) reducing usage to save money.  This bill takes takes away the \nlast two choices/incentives. \n\nAdopting \"rates by proxy\" (in a sense, indexed to PG&E and SCE rates) creates \nthe potential for a regulatory nightmare.\n\nAs an alternative, the Legislature should consider extending the voluntary \nopt-in program under existing law.  This would preserve existing protection, \nkeep choices available to customers, and not unduly add to DWR's burden.\n\nAs another alternative, we could be a lot more willing to accept this IF the \n\"end of the rate freeze\" date in (f) were specified to occur no earlier than \nthe date new rates are put in place (the proposed language from 18X, \nremember?) and it were clear that existing DA contracts were not overturned \nby this Act.",

Also the original person called in sick at the last\nmoment,\nand I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking\ndirections\nto the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two\njudges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and\nbesides\nthey told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted.\n\nHere are the scorecards from the event:\n\nChili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili\n\nJUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.\nJUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.\nFRANK: Holy cow, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried\n               paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers to\nput the\n               flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These Texans are\ncrazy.\n\nChili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili\n\nJUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.\nJUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken\n                        seriously.\nFRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am\n               supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two\npeople\n               who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to\n               walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on\nmy face.\n\nChili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili\n\nJUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.\nJUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.\nFRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I\n               have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by\nnow.\n               Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the\n\n               front part of my chest. I'm getting drunk.\n\nChili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic\n\nJUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.\nJUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or\n                        other mild foods, not much of a chili.\nFRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to\n               taste it. Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind me\nwith fresh refills;\n               that 300 lb. witch is starting to look HOT, just like\nthis nuclear-waste\n               I'm eating.\n\nChili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover\n\nJUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding\n                       considerable kick. Very impressive.\nJUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit\n                        the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.\nFRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted\n               and four people behind me needed paramedics. The\ncontestant\n               seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given\nme brain\n               damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring\nbeer directly\n               on it from a pitcher. It really pisses me off that the\nother judges asked\n               me to stop screaming.  Rednecks!\n\nChili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety\n\nJUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice\n\n                       and peppers.\nJUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic.\n                        Superb.\nFRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous,\nsulfuric\n               flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except\nbig Sally.\n               I need to sooth my butt with a snow cone!\n\nChili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili\n\nJUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.\nJUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of\nchili\n                        peppers at the last moment. I should note that I\nam worried\n                       about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit\nof distress\n                       as he is cursing uncontrollably.\nFRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't\n\n                feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and\nthe world sounds\n                like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered\nwith chili which\n                slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of\nlava-like stuff to\n                match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll\nknow what\n                killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too\npainful. Screw it, I'm\n                not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just\nsuck it in through\n                the 4 inch hole in my stomach.\n\nChili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili\n\nJUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all,\nnot too bold\n                       but spicy enough to declare its existence.\nJUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor\nhot. Sorry\n                        to see that most of it was lost when Judge\nNumber 3 passed out,\n                        fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself.\nNot sure if he's going\n                        to make it. Poor Yank.\nFRANK: --------------(editor's note: Judge #3 was unable To report)\n\n",

O. Box 26530, Austin, Texas 78755 -\nPhone\n512-795-8536\n\nJakes Becomes Horns' 20th Pledge, More Expected Soon\n\nDL Kaelen Jakes, 6-5, 260, 4.8, of Valencia, California, became Texas' 20th\ncommitment Thursday morning. He said he called UT assistant coach Tim\nBrewster early Thursday and told him he wanted to play for the Longhorns.\nJakes is one of the top defensive line prospects in California. He played\nnose guard most of last season, but played end for the final few games. He\nhad 60 solo tackles and 14 sacks. In the game I saw on tape, he was playing\nnose guard and he had seven solo tackles and two sacks while being\nconsistently double-teamed.\nHe told me he doesn't care whether he plays defensive end or defensive\ntackle. \"I just want to play,\" he said. \"I thought all along I probably\nwould\nwind up at Texas and, after looking at everything, I think Texas is the\nplace\nfor me.\"\nHe said he had scholarship offers from Colorado, Miami, USC, UCLA, Oregon,\nOregon State \"and just about everybody else in the Pac 10.\"\nHe narrowed it down to Texas and California, cancelling a scheduled trip to\nMiami, then got an in-house visit from Washington coach Rick Neuheisel\nTuesday night  from Longhorn head coach Mack Brown  and Brewster Wednesday\nmorning before picking the Longhorns.\nJakes lived in Plano during his junior high years and said he really\nenjoyed\nhis time in Texas.\n\"I think Texas is building something special,\" he said, \"and I want to be a\npart of it.\"\nJames fills an urgent need for Texas. The Longhorns need to sign some\ndefensive linemen and he and Tommy Harris, the big DT at Killeen Ellison,\nare\nthe only top ones who have been seriously considering Texas. Harris, the\nnation's top DT prospect, has been leaning toward OU recently, but he was a\nheavy Texas lean earlier, so there is always a chance he will change again\nuntil he signs with someone in February.\n* * * *\nWR Montrell Jones, 6-2, 185, 4.4, a national top 100 prospect from\nLouisville, Ky., Male, says he is seriously considering Texas after backing\noff an earlier commitment to Kentuckiy.\nThe Longhorns don't need a wide receiver this year unless they can sign a\ngreat one. Jones is a great one with good height, great speed and very good\nmoves to go along with great hands.\nThe only other out-of-state prospects who have expressed any interest in\nTexas lately  are TE Marcus Spears of  Baton Rouge Southern Lab, DT\nMarquise\nHill of New Orleans De La Salle and  RB Eric Shelton of Lexington, Ky.,\nBryan\nStation. The two Louisiana stars say they probably will visit Texas and\nShelton says he might visit the Longhorns.\n* * * *\nFOOTBALL NOTES: The Longhorns are 6-point favorites over Oregon for their\nDec. 29 Culligan Holiday Bowl clash in San Diego . . . Look for LB Aurmon\nSatchell of Denver Jefferson, who signed with Texas last February, but ran\ninto some academic problems with the NCAA's National Clearinghouse, to\nreturn\nto Texas and enroll next  month for the spring semester. That would enable\nhim to go through spring practice and it also would keep him from counting\nagainst the 25-man limit for the enrolling scholarship players next fall.\nWith 20 commitments already, that is very important. . . TE Brock Edwards\nand\nS Lee Jackson both appear to be recovered from the injuries that knocked\nthem\nout of the last two games last year. They should be ready for the bowl game\nunless they suffer a setback when practice resumes next week. . . When\nArizona hired former UT coach John Mackovic, the first thing that came to\nmy\nmind was how Mackovic basically threw in the towel after the 66-3 UCLA loss\nin his final 4-7 season coming on the heels of a 10-2 year that had given\nthe\nHorns a top 10 pre-season ranking. Fast forward to this season. Mack\nBrown's\nLonghorns were a pre-season top 10 team, but OU mauled them, 63-14. Brown\nsaid he was embarrassed to be the Longhorn coach and he really went to work\nto bring the team back from that debacle. What he got was six straight\nwins,\na bowl game and a team that can crack the top 10 in the final poll for the\nfirst time in 17 years if it wins its bowl game. That's why he's worth the\nbig bucks and the other quy wasn't.\n* * * *\nMy next fax will be whenever events warrant.\n* * * *\nThe True Orange Fax Service includes  at  least  99 faxes  a year and costs\n$99 ($79 by E-Mail).

Sorry, the complaint \nform wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed the\nform is the same that hired there ticketing help.\n\n-E\n\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nI recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was wonderful \nexcept for the fact that I traveled on your airline.  \n\nI was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for \nPhoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride \n(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the \nflight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because \nof foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for \nthis; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of \nthe danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no \ndanger involved in taking off in these conditions, which \nleads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was \nless than helpful in re-routing us on another airline \n(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us \nto Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that \nwe could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible \nto find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this \nconnection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on \nflights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.  \nIt now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my \nvacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.  \nI am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed \nour connection we were forced to spend a combined \n6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose, \nCO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead \nof arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten \nhours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of \nvacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again \nbecause of this experience.\n\nFor your research I provide the following data:\nPersons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, Shanna \nHusser, and Donnita Franklin.\n\nFinal Itinerary (after all changes) -\nFlt. 2765 Dec. 09 Iah-Phx 8:51AM\nFlt. 6244 Dec. 09 Phx-Mtj 3:34PM\n\nFlt. 6241 Dec. 14 Mtj-Phx 9:00AM\nFlt. 2273 Dec. 14 Phx-Iah  1:15PM\n\nSincerely,\n\nEric Bass",

That increased power demand to record levels.\n\nErcot's projected peak of 54,817 MW for summer 2000 wound up being 5%\nunder\nthe actual peak seen Aug. 31.\n\nSpot power prices jumped above $100 per megawatt-hour in four brief spikes\nlast summer, twice in May and again in July and August.\n\nWhile drought conditions have eased since last summer, the report warns\nthat\nErcot's peak could jump to 58,550 MW if forecasts provided by investor-owned\nutilities haven't included a possible shift in demand from customers\nparticipating in a retail pilot project that begins June 1.\n\nEven so, more than 3,350 MW of new generation is expected to be online\ncompared with last summer, pushing Ercot's net capacity resources to 65,064\nMW,\naccording to the report.\n\nThe Ercot assessment says the new generation should keep the region's\nreserve\nmargin above 20% in August when demand is expected to peak.\n\nThe Ercot report, however, includes 1,730 MW of \"border\" generation that\ncan\nbe sold into Ercot or into the Southwest Power Pool.\n\nA separate report from the Texas Public Utility Commission staff pointed\nout\nseveral additional merchant generating plants slated to come online this\nsummer\nin Ercot.\n\nThe PUC staff report paints a more bullish forecast for demand. The PUC\nsaid\ncoincident peak demand for power in Ercot grew at a compound rate of 4.3%\nfrom\n1995 to 2000.\n\nTotal annual energy consumption in Ercot grew by nearly 7.5% from 1999 to\n2000, according to the PUC.\n\nThe 21% reserve margin in August is twice the amount seen last summer. It\nincludes 2,870 MW of interruptible demand, slightly below last summer's\n3,000 MW\nof available load that could be curtailed.\n\nErcot transmission constraints are expected to be reduced dramatically\nthis\nsummer as an additional 345-kilovolt line running from Limestone power\nstation\nto the Watermill switchyard is expected to be in service this month,\nalleviating\nthe south-to-north congestion seen in the last two summers.\n\nAdditional lines are in the planning stages to relieve the west-to-east\nflow\nfrom Morgan Creek.\n\nOn June 1, Ercot will become a single control area as the region moves\ntoward\nfull retail competition beginning Jan. 1.\n\nThe current interregional transfer limit is 785 MW across the state's two\ndirect-current ties with SPP although there is expected to be some\nlimitation\nthis summer due to a breaker problem near the east DC tie.\n\nBecause Ercot lacks synchronous interconnection with the rest of the U.S.\npower grid, the region has limited ability to import electricity in times of\nhigh demand.\n\nErcot is a group of interconnected utilities that serves about 85% of the\npower load in the state.\n-By Eileen O'Grady; Dow Jones Newswires, 713-547-9213;\neileen.ogrady@dowjones.com <mailto:eileen.ogrady@dowjones.com>\n\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 01-05-01\n\n1546GMT\n\n(AP-DJ-05-01-01 1546GMT)\n:SUBJECT: EUTL DI4 TX\nCopyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones and Company, Inc.\nReceived by NewsEDGE/LAN: 5/1/01 11:40 AM",

The goal of the meeting \nwas to present a substantially complete \"Agreement of Long-Term Gas Purchase \nArrangement\"  to Battin this Thursday. Through this document they intend to \ndescribe what the parties have agreed to and the changes required in the bill \nto conform to the parties agreement. \n\nAttendees included PG&E and SDG&E (SCE is clearly opposed to the bill), \nCalpine, El Paso, Sithe and the CCC represented by White and Case. It appears \nthat SDG&E's support for the bill is weakening with their mantra being \"if \nthis doesn't guarantee a price reduction over the five years we won't support \nthe bill.\" We explained that the goal is not so much overall price reduction \nas price stabilization, with current period price reduction. PG&E clearly \ngets it. \n\nI was successful in introducing and inserting the financial hedging option \ninto the Gas Agreement. Both PG&E and SDG&E are very supportive of such an \noption as they are currently prohibited from entering into such arrangements. \nIt is less clear if the large QFs are supportive. Their primary goal is to \nfind a safe harbor from the Wood decision for the next five years. I also \nbelieve the proposed gas procurement structure provides some option value to \nthe larger QFs. \n\nAlthough it looks like our language will be in the Gas Agreement, I think we \nneed to get some language in the bill itself. I am working with Sandi and \nMike Day to make that happen. We may also want to add the concept of economic \ndispatch to the bill. Mike, do you have any suggested language that I could \nforward to Sandi and Mike Day? Finally, I suggest we try and set up \nindividual meetings with the utilities (including SCE) to discuss our ideas \nfurther. I'm not sure what other conversations are occurring with the \nutilities, but I would be happy to set up the meetings with the appropriate \npeople.\n\nThanks,\n\nMark\n\n\n\n\n\tAlan Comnes\n\t02/27/2001 08:32 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: David Parquet/SF/ECT@ECT, Michael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christopher F \nCalger/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mark Fillinger/SF/ECT@ECT, Sandra \nMcCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron, Hap Boyd/EWC/Enron@Enron, James D \nSteffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff \nDasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: QF Meeting Today--Highlights\n\nDespite the fact the bill, by itself, does not guarantee payment for overdue \nreceivables, the QFs on today's call decided to go forward and push for SBX \n47 irrespective of the progress on SBX 33.  A press conference is planned for \nFriday by IEP.  Bowen, who heads up the first committee that this bill will \ngo through will have hearings on this bill on Tuesday at the earliest.\n\nJan S-J asked every QF to fax to IEP a description of all QF generation and \nthe zip code of each project so that they can begin lobbying specific \nlegislators.  A significant PR push is planned.\n\nSBX 47 is opposed by SCE.  PG&E's position appears more ambivalent.  One \nangle would be to try to get PG&E to support Enron's swap/SC language and \nmake inclusion of such language a condition of PG&E's support.\n\nGAC\n\n\n",

Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true\nenvironmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm:\na polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income last\nyear.\n\n   2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is antismoking and anti-tobacco\nwhen  he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government\nsubsidies.\n\n   3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in fact\nhe was  placed by family influence in a \"cushy\"  correspondent's job and\nthe only  action he saw was that of his Brownie camera! (and his bong)\n\n   4. Gorons actually believe that Mr. Gore is justified in illegally\nraising political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the\nVanderbilt Law  educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.\n\n   5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al to accept large sums\nof political money from China through Buddhist monks who had taken vows\nof poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.\n\n   6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to \"invent the\nInternet\" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks\nof potentially  incriminating e-mail!\n\n   7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were\nthe models for the book and movie, \"Love Story\" even though the book's\nauthor,  Erich Segal, says not.\n\n   8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's\nchampion against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million\ndollars in Occidental Petroleum stock.\n\n   9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President\nClinton's immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain\nsilent on the subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton \"one of\nthe greatest Presidents of our history.\"\n\n   10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they\nwon't bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so\nineffective  that it has led to the election of Republicans as BOTH of\nTennessee's  Senators!\n\n   11.  Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will\nbe the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he served\nto the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down\nslum  house that he was renting to them.\n\n   CAUTIONARY NOTE: Medical researchers acknowledge that Gorons are\ngenerally harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,\nunfortunately, overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to\nactually vote for Gore! They should be carefully protected from their\nailment, since it may be  harmful to their well-being, yours, mine and\nthat of the USA.\n\n   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out to\naid the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and,  PLEASE, pass this on to\nyour normal  friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate\ntreatment.\n\n\n\n\n",

It looks like in CA ALL projects need to have CEQA \nreview regardless if they have been previously permitted or not.\n\nCOMPETITIVE LOCAL ENTRY\nCALIFORNIA\nALJ mulls penalty for Pacific Pipeline\n\nAdministrative Law Judge Sarah Thomas has decided to examine whether the\nPublic Utility Commission should penalize Pacific Pipeline Systems (PPS)\nfor constructing fiber optic facilities without first receiving PUC\napproval or undergoing an environmental review.  PPS has asked the PUC\nfor third-party access to fiber optic cable located in PPS's crude oil\npipelines.\n\nDuring a proceeding on PPS's request, the ALJ learned that the company\nalso intended to construct facilities to accommodate the third-party\naccess and lease them to Qwest Communications Corp.  PPS completed the\nconstruction after filing the application.\n\nThomas issued a draft decision granting the application and establishing\na second phase to consider whether PPS should be fined or sanctioned.\n(12/1/00 a.m.)  The commission withdrew the draft decision in order to\nconduct and complete the penalty phase before issuing a decision on the\napplication.\n\nDuring the penalty phase, the commission will examine (1) why PPS\nconstructed fiber optic facilities before obtaining PUC authorization or\nan environmental review and (2) whether the company violated the\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act, commission rules, the public\nutilities code, or any other legal requirements.  If the PUC determines\nthat PPS violated the law or commission rules, the commission will\ndecide whether and how the company should be penalized.\n\nThomas said she will hold a March 28 prehearing conference if PPS\nrequests one.  If the company decides against the hearing, it must file\na brief and its evidence by March 28.  (Application no. 99-11-027,\nApplication of Pacific Pipeline Systems LLC for Authorization Pursuant\nto Public Utilities Code Section 851 et seq.

Every year the \"people's \ngrape\" (aka \"mystery grape\" and \"California grape\") becomes more \npopular, and the tasting boasts more producers and consumers than \never before. The number of wines being poured, and the number of \npeople waving glasses, seems to reach critical mass, swelling with \nsuch huge and boisterous crowds that it can't possibly get \nany bigger. \n\nThe following year it increases by 50 percent. \n\nThis was what happened again on the Saturday before the Super Bowl, \nthe customary date of the tasting. A year ago, 6,000 tasters had \nflooded the Festival Pavilion at Fort Mason Center; this January \n(ZAP's 10th anniversary), the number was 9,200. For the first time \never, the event required two different buildings, where a total of \n500 wines were poured by 255 wineries. \n\nWhere will it all end? Well, it finished off the 1990s by showcasing \nwhat many were calling the best Zinfandel wines of the decade -- a \n\"spectacular\" vintage in the words of Ravenswood's Joel Peterson, who \nwent on to call it \"the best-balanced, most complex vintage we've \nhad. The wines have some of the fruit complexity of '91 and some of \nthe strength and power of '95; they're aren't over-the-top killers in \nterms of alcohol, but they have stuffing underneath.\" \n\nMichael Dashe of Dashe Cellars agreed that '99 constitutes \"manna \nfrom heaven. The wines are lush, concentrated, and intense, but \nbalanced.\" Donn Reisen of Ridge Vineyards called them \"awesome -- \nfull of rich, ripe, beautiful fruit.\" Bill Easton, whose '98 Easton \nEstate was one of the best Zinfandels of that year, felt that the \n'99s have \"a better fruit-tannin relationship,\" while David Noyes of \nKunde Estate found them \"surprisingly ready to drink -- I mean, \nthey're big wines.\" \n\nOf course winemakers are going to say things like that -- but the \ntasting seemed to bear out their claims. In terms of quality, the \n1999 Zinfandel vintage surpasses even the vaunted 1997, delivering a \npanoply of balanced wines with full, approachable flavors that don't \ntaste particularly alcoholic despite their ripeness. To Reisen this \nis evidence that \"Zinfandel winemaking is improving along with the \nquality of the fruit. Obviously, people are respecting the grape.\" \n\nPerhaps too much so abroad, if you paid attention to some of the \nbackstage scuttlebutt. Other than the beauty of '99, the talk among \ninsiders at the tasting concerned a recent decision by the European \nUnion (and expected agreement by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nand Firearms) to allow Italian winemakers to label wines made from \nthe Primitivo grape as Zinfandel. ZAP has supported research into \nZinfandel's European origins, resulting (among other things) in the \nscientific conclusion that it and the Primitivo di Puglia are the \nsame grape. \"The Italians called it Primitivo for a hundred years,\" \nnoted Reisen. \"But now that Zinfandel is so popular, they're trying \nto steal the brand.\" \n\n\"All [the research] really means is that Primitivo is a clone of \nZinfandel,\" said Ridge's president and winemaker, Paul Draper. \"The \nItalian move is purely commercial. It's like what happened in the old \ndays with Champagne and Burgundy and Chablis -- Americans tried to \ncapitalize on names that the French had taken years to build. ZAP was \ncreated to promote Zinfandel, not Primitivo -- but when you get down \nto it, who really cares? If, with its climate and soil, Puglia thinks \nit can compete with the best Zinfandel in the world, more power \nto them.\" \n\nLeon Sobon of Sobon Estates is going the opposite way. In Amador \nCounty in the Sierra Nevada foothills, he's making \"Primitivo\" from a \nclone imported from Italy. Sobon reported that Primitivo is easier to \ngrow than Zinfandel, resulting in \"more of a claret wine with less \nberry character.\" If you want to find out for yourself, try the Sobon \nEstates Primitivo. \n\nIn any case, ZAP is going on the offensive -- not with legal action \nagainst the Italians, but with \"EuroZAP,\" its first international \ntour. As you read this, a series of dinners, tastings, workshops, and \nseminars featuring Zinfandel wines and winemakers is now taking place \nin England, Germany, and other European countries. The aim, explained \nZAP Executive Director Rebecca Robinson, is \"to educate the world \nthat Zinfandel is grown in California and that it's America's \nHeritage Wine.\" \n\nTo check out wine.com's entire Zinfandel selection, click here. \n\n_____________________________________________________________________ \n\nWatch wine.com TV\n\nJoin us on the next \"Wine for Everyone\" show on Wednesday, March 7, \nfrom 10 p.m. to midnight EST.

This they cannot do.  California has a substantial investment in \nunits located in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.  The lights would go \nout in California if they opened the ties.  In the 1970's there was a hue and \ncry over loop flow, with California claiming that it was being injured by \nothers, particularly by the interior systems trading practices, however they \nnever considered opening the ties, because the benefits of interconnection \nwere so large that the \"cost\" of loop flow was far exceeded by the value of \nregional trade, i.e., they are economically interdependent.\n\n If such a foolish thing were done and California full \"closed its doors\" by \nopening its ties, cost would go up in the Northwest, in California and all \nthe rest of the Western System.  There are \"gains for trade\" which accrue to \nall parties from interconnection.  The trade is more complicated than just \nsummer/winter peaks (seasonal load diversity) there is also seasonal resource \ndiversity (Spring run off effects) and finally there opportunity to \ncapitalize on storage vs base load thermal operations.  I will address the \nlast point first to illustrate the complexity of the trading patterns.\n\n The interior west (Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico) has large \namount of base load coal plants.  As load drops off in those areas, the \nenergy flows to the coast to back off peaking plants and to back off hydro.  \nThe reduction of hydro production allows night time reservoir refill which \ncan be used to meet peak load in the Northwest and California.  This can be \nseen in the attached file, which contains a set of plots for hourly flow on \nthe Pacific DC Intertie Jun97, Dec 97, Jun 98, Dec 98, Jun 99, Dec 99, \nJun00.  In these plots the clear day/night exchange of energy can be seen, \nespecially in the Jun00 plot when sales are being made to California in the \nday and to the Northwest at night.  This day to night storage exchange \nbenefits lowers costs for everyone.\n\n On top of this daily/weekly cycle, there is the seasonal shift in load \ndiversity you noted.  For the Northwest, its peak load occurs when energy \nproduction is the lowest -- during the winter.  As a stand alone system, the \nPacific Northwest (i.e., the Columbia Drainage area) is energy constrained.  \nThe hydro in that area does not produce enough energy to meet annual needs.  \nThere is plenty of generating capacity to meet any peak, but not enough to \ntotal water flow.  Energy imports from Wyoming and Montana (e.g. Colstrip and \nBridger) are required to allow the Pacific Northwest to meet its annual \nenergy requirement.  With these energy inputs from the coal fields, the \nseasonal water budget can be arranged to get the most value out of the hydro \nsystem, although fish, navigation, irrigation, etc. impose an increasing \nnumber of constraints.  Energy imports from in the winter from the South help \nto meet this energy balance during the winter so water can be reserved until \nthe snow pack is better know in early Spring.  Some of the sales to the \nNorthwest from California during the winter are a result of displacement from \nDesert Southwest energy moving through California and then up the Interties \nto the Northwest.  \n\n Finally, the Spring run off/fish flush when production on the river is at a \nmaximum and load in the Northwest is down.  The sale of these surpluses paid \nfor the Pacific Intertie lines and remain important to the entire system.  \nMuch system maintenance of base load units has been historically been planned \nto take advantage of this factor.  Again both California and the Northwest \nbenefit from this trade.  \n\n In all cases, the parties would be worse off if the ties were open and \neveryone was on their own.  The Northwest may be capacity long, but it is \ntypically energy short, even in flush hydro years.  The winter energy imports \nfrom the South hold Northwest costs down just as spring run off sales to the \nSouth lower energy costs in California.  California cannot craft a solo \nsolution that ignores the rest of the West.  It is probably hard to decide \nwho would be worst off if California \"closed its doors\".  It is only clear \nthat total cost would rise in both California and the rest of the West from \nwhich it divorced itself.\n\n I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise.\n\nSteve\n\n\n\n\n\tJeff Dasovich@ENRON\n\tSent by: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON\n\t02/28/2001 11:35 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t cc: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve \nWalton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Richard \nShapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Cost of Protectionism\n\nTo Jim's last point.  I understand that the good 'ol utility system was often \noperated with little regard for basic economic principles, but there's \nsomething in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess, and it seems \nto always be tied to this notion that \"California is a net importer, even in \nthe winter.\"  I'm going to start with the economics and then let folks \ndescribe why it seemingly doesn't apply in Western electricity markets.\n\nJust about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion:  \nIf California closes it's doors the other Western states will pay higher \nprices for power and/or face increased threats to reliability.  I'm \nstruggling to try to determine why these basic principles aren't applicable \nto Western power markets.  I understand that the PNW is a very complex place \nand that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has \ndeveloped over the years.\n\nTo keep it simple (though not necessarily accurate), I've confined the \nanalysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist.\n\nThe basic situation: The PNW peaks in the winter; California peaks in the \nsummer.\n\nLet's take two scenarios:\n\n1)  The West, less California, is so awash in electricity that even in its \npeak--the Winter--it still has power to send to California, i.e., it has so \noverbuilt it's system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California.\n\nIrrespective, there have (to my limited knowledge) always been sales from CA \nto the PNW during the winter, when the PNW is peaking.\nThe only conclusion that one can make, assuming that the PNW is awash in \nelectricity, is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes \neconomic sense to do so. That is, during the winter peaking months, it must \nbe cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than \nproduce itself.  Otherwise, it's difficult to understand why it would buy \nfrom California during this month, particularly if they're long.  As such, at \na minimum, the PNW's electric bill will necessarily increase if California \ncloses its doors.\n\n2) Neither the PNW , nor California, has indigenous capacity to meet peaking \nload.  Therefore, the PNW must buy California's power during its peaking \nsummer period, and California must buy power during it's summer peaking \nperiod.  In this case, not only will the PNW's bill go up if California \ncloses its doors, the lights are likely to go because they'll be short power.\n\nI realize that this is a simplistic model, and that there could be other \nlegitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW \n(e.g., transmission costs).  And again, I also realize that economics may not \nhave traditionally been a driver in the industry.  But I thought it might be \nuseful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the \nquestion that Jim asks.\n\nWith that, I'll pose the question (understanding the simplicity of the model \nset forth above):  Given that California sends power north--even if the PNW \nis long---how can California closing it doors not increase the PNW's cost of \npower?\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n\n\n\tJames D Steffes\n\t02/28/2001 08:05 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve \nWalton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t Subject: Re: Cost of Protectionism\n\nIt seems to me that this information leads one to conclude that the value of \nan open transmission network is that California does not have to build 5,000 \nMW of power plant (4,500 MW max input + 10%) in state.  In other words, if \nCalifornia were to disconnect from the grid, someone would have to build \nadditional power plants in-state.\n\nThe cost to California consumers is therefore the annual carrying cost of 10 \n500 MW plants (made even more expensive after California expropriates the \ncurrent fleet of merchant generation).\n\nFrom the perspective of the remainder of the West, the question still remains \n- if California does go it alone, what is the economic impact?  Other than \nlegal arguments about Interstate Commerce, why should the Federal Government \nwant to continue to pursue open acess?  This is the hard question that we \nneed to answer.  \n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAlan Comnes@ECT\n\t02/27/2001 09:40 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t cc: Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Steve Walton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary \nHain/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Cost of Protectionism\n\nJim, Jeff:\n\nJim asked me in a voice mail what would be the cost to California of moving \nfrom the current (evolving) system of open access to a \"protectionist\" \nenvironment where access to the grid would be determined by a political body \nresponding to populist pressures.\n\nHere are some things to consider.  We can talk more and I welcome Sue Mara or \nSteve Walton's input:\n\nCalifornia is a net importer so any restraint of trade would risk the state \nbeing able to meet its own demand.  See attached slides that show PNW-CA \ntrade.  Even in the winter, power on a net basis flows south.\n\nLimiting open access would primarily act to hold in-state generators hostage.\n this will kill incentives for new investment\n\nIf the ISO's proposal for market power mitigation are any guide of where a \nprotectionist ISO would go:\n in-state generators would be required to sell forward or lose their market \nbased rate certificates\n load serving entities would be required to contract forward for load and a \nreserve margin.  \n  This is costly: it will lead to centralized planning solutions to \nreliability rather than more efficient market     outcomes\n Artifical notions of \"just and reasonable\" rates (on top of unreasonable \nreserve requirements) would lead to severe   reliability problems.  (In other \nwords, if Steve Peace has his way, the imports into the state will drop \noff     signficanly)\n\nThere is no reason the state would be more effective at expanding the grid \n(e.g., Path 15) than the current system.  (Although, admittedly the current \nsystem has flaws.  The CAISO was set up with little thought to transmission \nexpansion planning.  Other RTOs are not repeating this mistake.).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This can be \nseen in the attached file, which contains a set of plots for hourly flow on \nthe Pacific DC Intertie Jun97, Dec 97, Jun 98, Dec 98, Jun 99, Dec 99, \nJun00.  In these plots the clear day/night exchange of energy can be seen, \nespecially in the Jun00 plot when sales are being made to California in the \nday and to the Northwest at night.  This day to night storage exchange \nbenefits lowers costs for everyone.\n\n On top of this daily/weekly cycle, there is the seasonal shift in load \ndiversity you noted.  For the Northwest, its peak load occurs when energy \nproduction is the lowest -- during the winter.  As a stand alone system, the \nPacific Northwest (i.e., the Columbia Drainage area) is energy constrained.  \nThe hydro in that area does not produce enough energy to meet annual needs.  \nThere is plenty of generating capacity to meet any peak, but not enough to \ntotal water flow.  Energy imports from Wyoming and Montana (e.g. Colstrip and \nBridger) are required to allow the Pacific Northwest to meet its annual \nenergy requirement.  With these energy inputs from the coal fields, the \nseasonal water budget can be arranged to get the most value out of the hydro \nsystem, although fish, navigation, irrigation, etc. impose an increasing \nnumber of constraints.  Energy imports from in the winter from the South help \nto meet this energy balance during the winter so water can be reserved until \nthe snow pack is better know in early Spring.  Some of the sales to the \nNorthwest from California during the winter are a result of displacement from \nDesert Southwest energy moving through California and then up the Interties \nto the Northwest.  \n\n Finally, the Spring run off/fish flush when production on the river is at a \nmaximum and load in the Northwest is down.  The sale of these surpluses paid \nfor the Pacific Intertie lines and remain important to the entire system.  \nMuch system maintenance of base load units has been historically been planned \nto take advantage of this factor.  Again both California and the Northwest \nbenefit from this trade.  \n\n In all cases, the parties would be worse off if the ties were open and \neveryone was on their own.  The Northwest may be capacity long, but it is \ntypically energy short, even in flush hydro years.  The winter energy imports \nfrom the South hold Northwest costs down just as spring run off sales to the \nSouth lower energy costs in California.  California cannot craft a solo \nsolution that ignores the rest of the West.  It is probably hard to decide \nwho would be worst off if California \"closed its doors\".  It is only clear \nthat total cost would rise in both California and the rest of the West from \nwhich it divorced itself.\n\n I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise.\n\nSteve\n\n\n\n\n\tJeff Dasovich@ENRON\n\tSent by: Jeff Dasovich@ENRON\n\t02/28/2001 11:35 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t cc: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve \nWalton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Richard \nShapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Re: Cost of Protectionism\n\nTo Jim's last point.  I understand that the good 'ol utility system was often \noperated with little regard for basic economic principles, but there's \nsomething in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess, and it seems \nto always be tied to this notion that \"California is a net importer, even in \nthe winter.\"  I'm going to start with the economics and then let folks \ndescribe why it seemingly doesn't apply in Western electricity markets.\n\nJust about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion:  \nIf California closes it's doors the other Western states will pay higher \nprices for power and/or face increased threats to reliability.  I'm \nstruggling to try to determine why these basic principles aren't applicable \nto Western power markets.  I understand that the PNW is a very complex place \nand that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has \ndeveloped over the years.\n\nTo keep it simple (though not necessarily accurate), I've confined the \nanalysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist.\n\nThe basic situation: The PNW peaks in the winter; California peaks in the \nsummer.\n\nLet's take two scenarios:\n\n1)  The West, less California, is so awash in electricity that even in its \npeak--the Winter--it still has power to send to California, i.e., it has so \noverbuilt it's system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California.\n\nIrrespective, there have (to my limited knowledge) always been sales from CA \nto the PNW during the winter, when the PNW is peaking.\nThe only conclusion that one can make, assuming that the PNW is awash in \nelectricity, is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes \neconomic sense to do so. That is, during the winter peaking months, it must \nbe cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than \nproduce itself.  Otherwise, it's difficult to understand why it would buy \nfrom California during this month, particularly if they're long.  As such, at \na minimum, the PNW's electric bill will necessarily increase if California \ncloses its doors.\n\n2) Neither the PNW , nor California, has indigenous capacity to meet peaking \nload.  Therefore, the PNW must buy California's power during its peaking \nsummer period, and California must buy power during it's summer peaking \nperiod.  In this case, not only will the PNW's bill go up if California \ncloses its doors, the lights are likely to go because they'll be short power.\n\nI realize that this is a simplistic model, and that there could be other \nlegitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW \n(e.g., transmission costs).  And again, I also realize that economics may not \nhave traditionally been a driver in the industry.  But I thought it might be \nuseful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the \nquestion that Jim asks.\n\nWith that, I'll pose the question (understanding the simplicity of the model \nset forth above):  Given that California sends power north--even if the PNW \nis long---how can California closing it doors not increase the PNW's cost of \npower?\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n\n\n\tJames D Steffes\n\t02/28/2001 08:05 AM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve \nWalton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t Subject: Re: Cost of Protectionism\n\nIt seems to me that this information leads one to conclude that the value of \nan open transmission network is that California does not have to build 5,000 \nMW of power plant (4,500 MW max input + 10%) in state.  In other words, if \nCalifornia were to disconnect from the grid, someone would have to build \nadditional power plants in-state.\n\nThe cost to California consumers is therefore the annual carrying cost of 10 \n500 MW plants (made even more expensive after California expropriates the \ncurrent fleet of merchant generation).\n\nFrom the perspective of the remainder of the West, the question still remains \n- if California does go it alone, what is the economic impact?  Other than \nlegal arguments about Interstate Commerce, why should the Federal Government \nwant to continue to pursue open acess?  This is the hard question that we \nneed to answer.  \n\nJim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAlan Comnes@ECT\n\t02/27/2001 09:40 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t cc: Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Steve Walton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary \nHain/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Cost of Protectionism\n\nJim, Jeff:\n\nJim asked me in a voice mail what would be the cost to California of moving \nfrom the current (evolving) system of open access to a \"protectionist\" \nenvironment where access to the grid would be determined by a political body \nresponding to populist pressures.\n\nHere are some things to consider.  We can talk more and I welcome Sue Mara or \nSteve Walton's input:\n\nCalifornia is a net importer so any restraint of trade would risk the state \nbeing able to meet its own demand.  See attached slides that show PNW-CA \ntrade.  Even in the winter, power on a net basis flows south.\n\nLimiting open access would primarily act to hold in-state generators hostage.\n this will kill incentives for new investment\n\nIf the ISO's proposal for market power mitigation are any guide of where a \nprotectionist ISO would go:\n in-state generators would be required to sell forward or lose their market \nbased rate certificates\n load serving entities would be required to contract forward for load and a \nreserve margin.  \n  This is costly: it will lead to centralized planning solutions to \nreliability rather than more efficient market     outcomes\n Artifical notions of \"just and reasonable\" rates (on top of unreasonable \nreserve requirements) would lead to severe   reliability problems.  (In other \nwords, if Steve Peace has his way, the imports into the state will drop \noff     signficanly)\n\nThere is no reason the state would be more effective at expanding the grid \n(e.g., Path 15) than the current system.  (Although, admittedly the current \nsystem has flaws.  The CAISO was set up with little thought to transmission \nexpansion planning.  Other RTOs are not repeating this mistake.).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "Mike, Clint-\n\nI've done some more research on water usage and have some revised consumption \nrates which are less than what I told you last week.\n\nUsing the rates that I have listed below, if you run 5 days/week (weekdays), \n16 hours/day (not 15 as I previously mentioned) say 6 am to 10 pm, at GE's \nworse case consumption rate (+20% margin) , the tank will just be empty \nFriday night (10 pm) at the end of the 16 hour run.  I then takes \napproximately 42 hours to refill the tank.  (filling is completed by late \nSunday afternoon)\n\nAt GE's \"expected\" consumption rate (no margin), the consumption rate is so \nmuch better that you could potentially run for 15 days straight, at 16 \nhours/day before you exhausted the tank.\n\nNext week when we run the performance test, we will know exactly what the \nactual consumtion rates will be.  In addition, I think (hope) that there \nmight be some additional capacity in the demin plant.  The 120 gpm number is \nthe guarantee from the vendor and at that rate the water quality is better \nthan what we need.  I'm going to see if I can get someone to increase the \nflowrate until we are just at the limits for water quality.  I'll let you \nknow what that number is. \n\nI do agree with you in that extra demin capacity is a no brainer.  Hopefully \nby the end of next week, I will know exactly how much extra we would need.\n\nBy the way, there is one additional piece of info that I was informed of \ntoday.  I been told that there is some language in the participation \nagreement that says our variable O&M costs increases after we exceed 1300 \nhours of operation.\n\nHope this helps.  If you have questions, give me a call.  I'm in Austin all \nweek.\n\nThanks,\nEric Booth\nx54683\n(713) 412-6873 (c)\n\nConsumption/Make-up Rates:\nDemin plant make-up rate: 120 gpm\nDemin Tank capacity:  300,000 gallons\n\nMaximum or worse case Consumption rate of the plant with all four units \nrunning full load:  236 gpm  (this has a +20% margin included by GE)\nTherefor, when the plant is running, net drawdown rate on the tank is \n(236-120) = 116 gpm\n\nExpected consumption rate for the plant with all four units running at full \nload:  197 gpm (this does not have any extra margin included)\nTherefor, when the plant is running, net drawdown rate on the tank is \n(197-120) = 77 gpm",

The closer alignment of our wholesale=20\r\nbusinesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20\r\ncoordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=\r\n=20\r\nhigher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20\r\nopportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=\r\nf=20\r\nEnron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=\r\nd=20\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nEnron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=\r\n=20\r\n(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20\r\noperations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=\r\nnit=20\r\nas well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=\r\nrchant=20\r\nbusinesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=\r\n=20\r\nnew structure as described below.\r\n\r\nMark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=\r\ne=20\r\nthe role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20\r\ncurrently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=\r\n=20\r\nof the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.\r\n\r\nProviding further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=\r\n=20\r\ninternational business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=\r\np=20\r\npositions:\r\n\r\nRebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=\r\n=20\r\nand CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=\r\ny=20\r\nfor managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=\r\north=20\r\nAmerica and Europe.

Following the=20\r\ntransition, Jim will join EES.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20\r\nactivities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=\r\n=20\r\nbusinesses and the commercial support functions:\r\n\r\nEnron Net Works\r\nLouise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=\r\n and=20\r\nCEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20\r\n\r\nEnron Americas\r\nConcurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=\r\n=20\r\noperating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20\r\nmarketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=\r\nt=20\r\ninto a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=\r\n=20\r\nfor all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20\r\nAmerica.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20\r\nOperating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20\r\nAmericas.\r\n\r\nEnron Europe\r\nThe Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=\r\nralia=20\r\nand Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=\r\n=20\r\nSherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.\r\n\r\nEnron Global Markets\r\nEnron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=\r\n=20\r\nCEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20\r\nresponsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20\r\nexception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20\r\nassociated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=\r\n=20\r\nEnron Global Assets.

We are creating no incremental overhead in=\r\n=20\r\nthe creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=\r\n=20\r\nefficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.\r\n\r\nTo this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=\r\n=20\r\nEWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=\r\n=20\r\nnewly defined roles are as follows:\r\n\r\nMid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=\r\ne=20\r\nOperations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=\r\n=20\r\nwith Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20\r\nPresident and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=\r\ned=20\r\nservices organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20\r\nwholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=\r\n=20\r\nservices.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=\r\n=20\r\ncontinue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=\r\n=20\r\nfor specific commodities and/or geographic locations.\r\nLegal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.\r\nRegulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =\r\non a=20\r\nregional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=\r\n=20\r\nthe Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=\r\n=20\r\nEuropean and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=\r\nue=20\r\nto support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=\r\n=20\r\nand will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=\r\nef=20\r\nof Staff.\r\nPublic Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=\r\nal=20\r\nbasis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20\r\nEnron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=\r\n=20\r\nin her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=\r\nr=20\r\nwill have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=\r\n=20\r\nwell as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=\r\n =20\r\nThese individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=\r\n=20\r\nto Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.\r\nBusiness Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=\r\nver=20\r\nEWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.\r\n\r\nAttached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20\r\nServices which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=\r\n=20\r\ncontinues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.\r\n\r\nENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION\r\nAND ENRON WIND\r\n\r\n As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=\r\nts=20\r\naround the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=\r\n=20\r\nEGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=\r\nf=20\r\nBaxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=\r\nnron=20\r\nWind, will report to Cliff.\r\n\r\nCORPORATE STAFF\r\n\r\n We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20\r\nGovernment Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=\r\n=20\r\nthat regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=\r\n=20\r\nCommunity Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=\r\nd=20\r\nChief of Staff.\r\n\r\nCOMMITTEE STRUCTURE\r\n\r\n In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=\r\n=20\r\ngrowth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20\r\nbusiness unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=\r\n=20\r\nbe the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=\r\nnd=20\r\nthe coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20\r\ndrawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20\r\nperformance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =\r\n=20\r\nThe Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.\r\n\r\n We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=\r\ntee. =20\r\nThis group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20\r\nmanagement policy and corporate strategy.

This legislation extends a rate cap type rate stabilization\nplan until March 31, 2003.  The language included a \"flexible\" rate cap so\nthat the commission can increase rates to reflect variations in the cost of\ngas and electricity, etc.   It has some language to ensure that the\n\"customers which benefit from stabilized rates do not avoid costs associated\nwith providing the stabilized rates\".   This would seemingly prevent cost\nshifting and retroactive ratemaking.    The main thrust is to allow the\nutility to recover all  non-CTC costs during this period.  It specifically\namends Section 368(a) to eliminate a provision which appears to require the\nutilities to absorb all costs (including CTC) not recovered by the end of\nthe transition period.\n\nMy main reaction is that this bill is not necessary.  The SCE and PG&E caps\nare still in place and will be in place through most if not all of 2001.\nThis bill is being offered now to increase its chances of passage in the\n\"crisis mode\" now prevalent.  It should be deferred until the commission has\nproceeded farther with its investigation.\n\nMike Day\n\n - X16049.DOC",

The most important thing is that we not get a retroactive end of the \nrate freeze (retroactive to any time before the date of the order).  We may \nalso accomplish this through legislation.\n\nRegarding the book vs. market valuation, it is less important that we argue \nfor market or book than it is we should clarify for the commission how and \nwhy it should be consistent with the new legislation.  If new legislation \noccurs and means that utility generation will be priced at cost for 10 years, \nthen everyone needs to realize that is a fundamentally different construct.  \nDA Customers are not getting the value of these plants through the valuation \nprocess so they must have access to that value through the access to retained \ngeneration approach. If cost based rates are not legislated, market valuation \nshoud proceed.  What we don't want is for them to legislate cost-based rates \nand then forget about the value being stripped from DA.\n\nAlso, seems like it could be a good thing to point out that if they do \ndeclare an end to the rate freeze, if it is effective before new replacement \nlegislation is enacted, they've only created another quagmire.   I'll call to \ndiscuss.\n\n\n\n\tJMB <JBennett@GMSSR.com>\n\t02/26/2001 10:32 AM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: \"'Bob Frank (E-mail)'\" <robert.frank@enron.com>, \"'Harry Kingerski \n(E-mail)'\" <Harry.Kingerski@enron.com>, \"'Jeff Dasovich (E-mail)'\" \n<jdasovic@enron.com>, \"'Sue Mara (E-mail)'\" <smara@enron.com>, \"'Tamara \nJohnson (E-mail)'\" <tjohnso8@enron.com>, \"'sstoness@enron.com'\" \n<sstoness@enron.com>\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: Brief in Rate Stabilization Proceeding\n\nDespite the fact that the hearings will probably continue into Wednesday of\nthis week, the briefs in Phase I of the Rate Stabilization Proceeding are\nstill due this Friday the 2nd.  One of the issues before the  ALJ is the use\nof interim versus final market valuation to end the rate freeze.  I am very\nhesitant to say that the rate freeze cannot end on the basis of a Commission\napproved interim valuation as Enron has, in previous proceedings, taken the\nposition that it can.  Please let me know right away if you feel different\nabout this.  Along these same lines, the issue of the value of the assets is\nsomewhat at play (at least on an interim basis).  Do we want to take a\nposition that the assets need to be market valued (rather than book) thus\nincreasing the rate base for the purpose of cost of service regulation which\nthe assets are now under? Increased generation rate would mean an increased\nDA credit. However, it may also hurt our claim that we should get a piece of\nthe retained generation.

For more information about CITM, please see: \n\nwww.haas.berkeley.edu/citm\n\nCITM recently began a new project, \"Enabling eBusiness,\" that studies the \nmigration to the Internet of companies across all industries.? Surveys and \nfield studies at user and vendor companies and interaction with industry \norganizations and other research institutions will provide insight into, and \ncase studies on, such topics as aligning business and IT strategy, best \npractices, build vs. buy, and organization structures.? \n\nTo kick off the Enabling Ebusiness project, CITM held a major conference Dec. \n6, 2000 with experts from industry and academia who focussed on the \nopportunities presented by Ebusiness, strategies for achieving them and for \novercoming legacies (technologies, processes, people and organizations).? The \nkeynote speaker was George Surdu, Director of Information Technology Services \nfor the Ford Motor Company, one of the sponsors of CITM. \n\nThe conference was very well received and it is apparent that these issues \nare of interest to many companies.? Therefore, CITM is offering another \nconference on May 22, from 9 - 5 with a reception following in the early \nevening.? Our keynote speaker will be Steve Ellis, EVP of Wells Fargo's \nWholesale Internet Solutions Group.? Also on the agenda: J_rgen Lutz, \neProcurement, Bayer AG Leverkusen, and Mark V.

We are more mature. We understand more. We play=\r\n=20\r\nharder and are better conditioned and stronger than a year ago.\"=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 On having four turnovers in last year's game with UT:=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 \"Turnovers were a major factor. We had two interceptions that hit us ri=\r\nght=20\r\nin the chest and we drop. Both of those interceptions led to scores for=20\r\nthem.\"=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 On UT's quarterback rotation:=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 \"I don't bother to speculate why they do something or not. They run the=\r\n same=20\r\noffense with both (Major) Applewhite and (Chris) Simms. I'm sure we'll see =\r\na=20\r\ngood part of Applewhite. I know who our starting quarterback will be, and=\r\n=20\r\nhe'll be in there the whole go unless something happens.\"=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 On OU's running game:=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 \"I hope our running game is a factor in this game.

What's the chance of this happening in the near term? =20\r\n=09 ?? Waxer, Dallas=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Well, former UT regent Tom Hicks (owner of the Dallas Stars and=\r\n=20\r\nTexas Rangers) wants it done and is willing to help pay for it, so there is=\r\n a=20\r\ngood chance some movement on this could happen in the next few years. UT=20\r\nwould start by expanding and closing in the north end of Royal-Memorial. Th=\r\nen=20\r\nthe focus would turn to the south end.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09[IMAGE]=20\r\n=09Kalen Thornton =20\r\n=09\r\n=09Q: What happened to Adam Doiron?=20\r\n=09?? Morris W. Collie, Houston=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Adam Doiron was initially projected by UT defensive coordinator=\r\n Carl=20\r\nReese to be the top defensive end of the freshman class. He thought Doiron=\r\n=20\r\nwould be the best run stopper of the bunch, and since that's an area Texas=\r\n=20\r\nwants to improve, Reese figured Doiron might play early on. But DE Kalen=20\r\nThornton moved ahead of Doiron during the pre-season, and now Reese is=20\r\nconsidering redshirting Doiron. Doiron recently started working at defensiv=\r\ne=20\r\ntackle, and if any more players go down at that position, Doiron could see=\r\n=20\r\nplaying time. The coaches like him, but might want to build for the future =\r\nby=20\r\nholding him out this season.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: I was very happy to see some positive things from our offense in the=\r\n =20\r\nsecond half, especially the running of Kenny Hayter, but I have a  question=\r\n=20\r\nabout the punt team.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09It's obvious that opposing teams'  philosophy is to not call \"fair catch=\r\n.\" I=20\r\nfirst noticed this against  Nebraska last year. And I certainly think that=\r\n=20\r\nmaking an early tackle by  invading the \"halo\" and receiving a 5-yard penal=\r\nty=20\r\nis much better than  sitting back and possibly allowing a big return.\r\n=09\r\n=09But if we're going to  get the penalty, why not lay our ears back and po=\r\np the=20\r\nreceiver in the  mouth whether he's caught the ball or not? A big hit would=\r\n=20\r\nmake that  penalty a little easier to swallow, don't you think?=20\r\n=09?? Cody Anderson, Houston, Texas=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  No question about it. First, you want to try to avoid getting t=\r\nhe=20\r\npenalty. But if you are going to get the penalty, then get your money's wor=\r\nth=20\r\nand give that returner something to remember for next time.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09I hate this rule. Colorado coach Gary Barnett went so far as to say that=\r\n=20\r\nagainst a team with great returners, such as Kansas State, who has David=20\r\nAllen, it's better to violate the halo rule and tackle these guys, take the=\r\n=20\r\n5-yard penalty and keep them from breaking one 60 or 70 yards for a score.=\r\n=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: It seems like I've been waiting forever for the offensive line to cl=\r\nick.=20\r\nDid something come together finally or have I not been paying attention? (I=\r\n=20\r\nam out of state and am limited to TV and had to miss one game.)=20\r\n=09?? Jerry Secrets=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  No, things did click in the second half of the Oklahoma State g=\r\name.=20\r\nThe running game used a gap-blocking scheme that focuses more on blocking=\r\n=20\r\nangles than individual players. On running plays, the guard opposite the pl=\r\nay=20\r\nside was pulling and creating some room for cutbacks. Mack Brown said the=\r\n=20\r\nteam had used the gap scheme in the past and it just didn't work. But last=\r\n=20\r\nSaturday, it did.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: Will Sean Rogers play on Saturday?=20\r\n=09?? Rick Bush, Dallas=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  I think it's doubtful. Rogers didn't practice Tuesday and was s=\r\ntill=20\r\nseen with his walking boot on to protect his sprained ankle. But I'm sure h=\r\ne=20\r\nand the coaches will evaluate his status right up until game time. Those hi=\r\ngh=20\r\nankle sprains can be a nightmare if they don't heal properly, however. No o=\r\nne=20\r\nwants to rush him back and then lose him for the season because his return=\r\n=20\r\nwas premature.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09[IMAGE]=20\r\n=09Josh Heupel =20\r\n=09\r\n=09Q: OU has a great passing attack. Do you feel that Texas' young secondar=\r\ny can=20\r\nanswer the call? =20\r\n=09 ?? Marty Wagner=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  This is the battle of the game, in my opinion: OU's receivers v=\r\ns.=20\r\nUT's secondary. If OU quarterback Josh Heupel goes unpressured, the UT=20\r\nsecondary might need therapy after this game. But Rod =20\r\n=09\r\n=09Babers and Quentin Jammer have made progress each game. If Lee Jackson i=\r\ns=20\r\nback, he'll play strong safety, and Greg Brown would move from SS back to=\r\n=20\r\nfree safety. That means Dakarai Pearson goes back to the nickel back, which=\r\n=20\r\nin this game, is good news for UT. You need Pearson in the game as much as=\r\n=20\r\npossible. In my opinion, he breaks on the ball better than most of UT's=20\r\nD-backs.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: How do you see the Texas-Oklahoma game shaping up? What will be the =\r\nkeys?=20\r\n=09?? Sara Wilson=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  I think the offenses are equal, so it will come down to who pla=\r\nys=20\r\nthe best defense. I think Texas has the better defense, even without Shaun=\r\n=20\r\nRogers. So I see Texas winning, 24-20. Turnovers will change the complexion=\r\n=20\r\nof the game, of course. But I think UT is catching OU at the right time aft=\r\ner=20\r\npicking up some much-needed confidence on offense against Oklahoma State.=\r\n=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: Now that the quarterback experiment SHOULD be officially over at Tex=\r\nas,=20\r\ndo you expect Major Applewhite to start and play the entire game against OU=\r\n?=20\r\nAlso (looking ahead to next year because this year it is no longer an issue=\r\n),=20\r\ndo you think Major Applewhite would be a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidat=\r\ne=20\r\nIF he were to start every game and take 90 percent of the snaps?=20\r\n=09\r\n=09My two cents ... I think the Texas coaches better start treating Major=\r\n=20\r\nApplewhite like one of the best college quarterbacks in the country, which =\r\nhe=20\r\nobviously is, and start treating Chris Simms like the second-best quarterba=\r\nck=20\r\nat the University of Texas, which he might be. (I say might because I haven=\r\n't=20\r\nseen Chance Mock play in a game. He might be better than Simms.)=20\r\n=09 ?? Clint Mickey=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Major Applewhite will start against Oklahoma (based on repetiti=\r\nons=20\r\nwith the first team in practice this week) and I would be shocked if he=20\r\ndoesn't play most or all of this game. In fact, I think Major will play mos=\r\nt=20\r\nor all of the next two games.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09If UT beats OU, the Colorado game will be one of those nightmare games=\r\n=20\r\nbecause UT will be fighting a letdown and the Buffaloes will probably still=\r\n=20\r\nbe winless (the Bufs play at A=02?this week).  So, these next two games are=\r\n all=20\r\nabout experience. But I think Simms will be back in action when UT takes on=\r\n=20\r\nMissouri on Oct. 21 because the coaches are sticking with the notion of=20\r\nhaving two starting quarterbacks.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09I think Applewhite would be a Heisman Trophy candidate this season if he=\r\n had=20\r\nbeen the lone starter. It's just impossible to think of yourself as the bes=\r\nt=20\r\nplayer in the nation, I would think, when your coaches don't think you're t=\r\nhe=20\r\nbest QB on your own team.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09As far as next year, you would have to think the coaches are going to=20\r\ncontinue this rotation because they have not backed off of it much this=20\r\nseason. We'll see. Mock is still two years away unless Applewhite or Simms=\r\n=20\r\ngets injured.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09[IMAGE]=20\r\n=09Major Applewhite =20\r\n=09\r\n=09Q: It's become obvious to everyone outside MackWorld that Major Applewhi=\r\nte=20\r\nhas established himself as the one and only starting quarterback at Texas. =\r\nIt=20\r\nhas become ridiculous to call both quarterbacks \"starters\" and insist on=20\r\ntoken starts for Chris Simms.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09It seems to me it would be less demeaning to Simms to name Applewhite as=\r\n THE=20\r\nstarter and bring Simms in for quality playing time during the game instead=\r\n=20\r\nof allowing him two series, then yanking him in favor of the REAL starter w=\r\nho=20\r\nthen plays the rest of the game. The current charade hasn't fooled anyone. =\r\nAs=20\r\nfine as Simms' =20\r\n=09\r\n=09talent appears to be, this is Major's team.  Any comments? =20\r\n=09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  I talked to Major one-on-one on Monday, and he said he didn't=\r\n=20\r\nrealize how much confidence he had lost this season until he got the infusi=\r\non=20\r\nof confidence by leading Texas on five straight scoring drives of the secon=\r\nd=20\r\nhalf against Oklahoma State. If the coaches are insistent about this=20\r\nrotation, it will be interesting to see if Applewhite can continue to=20\r\nmaintain or build on the confidence he seized in the OSU game. =20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: What is happening with special teams? I know they have had some rece=\r\nnt=20\r\nsuccess after missed tackles and have improved, but what I cannot understan=\r\nd=20\r\nis why the opposing team can get so close to Kris Stockton and UT, with=20\r\nsuperior recruiting and athletes, can not even get close. This has really=\r\n=20\r\nhurt us. How is our blocking so different? Why does this problem persist? =\r\n=20\r\n=09?? Chad Dieterichs=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  It sure appears to me that the players on the line are giving w=\r\nay=20\r\ntoo much ground after the snap. Almost every punt this season has been a=20\r\nmatter of, can Stockton get the punt off before the opposing team collapses=\r\n=20\r\nonto Stockton's pocket?=20\r\n=09\r\n=09Mack Brown gets very upset with questions about the punt team. He says t=\r\nhat=20\r\nthey use the same formation that every NFL team uses and that special teams=\r\n=20\r\nare prone to breakdowns because there aren't enough scholarships to recruit=\r\n=20\r\nspecial teams players. And he says young players have to be used because=20\r\nveterans get tired playing offense and defense.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09I asked Mack if he thought that members of the punt team were starting t=\r\no=20\r\nhave a mental block, now that two punts have been blocked this season. He=\r\n=20\r\nsaid he didn't know. He said the latest punt block against Oklahoma State w=\r\nas=20\r\nthe result of OSU players twisting and a UT player failing to pick up the=\r\n=20\r\nassignment. At least this time, the punt blocker didn't run untouched throu=\r\ngh=20\r\nthe middle of the line.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: I think people get too caught up in what's happening right now to re=\r\nalize=20\r\nwhat this team will be in a year or two. All we've heard about is how=20\r\nwonderful Mack's recruiting has been and how loaded we are, yet how the=20\r\nO-line is less than impressive and how the QB situation is hurting us.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09Guess what? Most of these \"great\" players are only 18. Remember Ricky as=\r\n a=20\r\nfreshman? Didn't think so. Think about how solid we will be in two years wi=\r\nth=20\r\ncurrent players and the new recruits coming in. So if we lose another game =\r\nor=20\r\ntwo this season and end up in the Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl, no=\r\n=20\r\nbiggie.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09In a year or two, we'll be right in there. So here's my question. What w=\r\nill=20\r\nit take for Texas to be consistently rated up there with the great college=\r\n=20\r\nprograms? Right now, as a friend of mine would say, we have a good team and=\r\n=20\r\nwe're building a good program. It seems that Texas is heading in that=20\r\ndirection, but we have a little way yet to go. What does Texas need to be a=\r\n=20\r\ntrue Top 10 team? Is it personnel-based or is it about chemistry? =20\r\n=09?? Alex Kephart, Dallas=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  I think it has to do with chemistry and experience at this poin=\r\nt.=20\r\nThe talent is there. Mack Brown is recruiting winners. But each of the line=\r\ns=20\r\nhas to have experience, and there have to be some \"Braveheart\"-type leaders=\r\n=20\r\non the team.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09Right now, the offensive line is still growing, even though it has two=\r\n=20\r\nseniors. The defensive line has great senior tackles, but the ends are raw.=\r\n=20\r\nSo the defensive line probably won't be great again after this year for a=\r\n=20\r\ncouple years, if you believe that you need senior lines to win a national=\r\n=20\r\nchampionship.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09But I agree with you. Texas has all the makings of being a powerhouse in=\r\nstead=20\r\nof just a good team in the next two to three years. Everyone will put the=\r\n=20\r\nLonghorns back up in the Top 5 next year because of their schedule. But Tex=\r\nas=20\r\nwill be a veteran team with great depth in the next two to three years.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09Right now, Texas and its fans and even the media have been guilty (me=20\r\nincluded) of holding Texas to the same standard as Nebaraska and Florida=20\r\nState. But that's probably not fair just yet. The stud players Brown is=20\r\nrecruiting need time to settle into the system and get some experience. In=\r\n=20\r\nthe next couple years, Texas will justifiably be held to the same standard =\r\nas=20\r\nthe perennial powers.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: : I have two questions for you Chip: A) Does The University still ha=\r\nve=20\r\nthe longest scoring streak in NCAA football? B) If I find myself looking at=\r\n=20\r\nNEXT year's schedule after a payback loss at Stanford, do I need profession=\r\nal=20\r\nhelp? (P.S. You may also want to remind your readers we should NEVER feel=\r\n=20\r\nguilty about running up the score against U of H.)=20\r\n=09?? Arland Bishop=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Texas has scored in a Big 12-record 231 straight games, dating =\r\nback=20\r\nto a 16-0 loss at Baylor in 1980. That is the second-longest active streak =\r\nin=20\r\nthe nation. BYU holds the longest scoring streak: 318 games.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09Next year's schedule is even more appetizing than this year's schedule. =\r\nThe=20\r\nonly non-conference road game is at Houston. The non-conference home games=\r\n=20\r\nare New Mexico State and North Carolina. And the Big 12 schedule has Colora=\r\ndo=20\r\nin Austin. UT will have Oklahoma in Dallas (as usual) and Texas A=02?at Kyl=\r\ne=20\r\nField.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09So, no, you don't need therapy. If anything, next year's schedule should=\r\n be=20\r\nanother reason to have patience with this year's team. Good times are=20\r\nobviously on the horizon.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: I know the subject has been worn into the ground, but I haven't hear=\r\nd=20\r\nthis view from anyone so ... In the mid-'90s Florida State was struggling=\r\n=20\r\nearly in the season with a young, talented QB named Charlie Ward (of course=\r\n).=20\r\nThey were winning the early games against less-talented teams, but just=20\r\nbarely. Then, they finally put Ward in the shotgun on virtually every down=\r\n=20\r\nand let him do his magic.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09It was like night and day.  Basically, what they did was abandon their m=\r\nore=20\r\nbalanced attack and did what their talent dictated they could do - pass ear=\r\nly=20\r\nand often. The run was still used, but it was more to complement the pass.=\r\n=20\r\n=09\r\n=09I know UT is not in the exact situation, but this may make sense for the=\r\nm.=20\r\nThe only time I thought the UT offense looked really good this year was rig=\r\nht=20\r\nwhen Major Applewhite first came in against Louisiana-Lafayette and drove=\r\n=20\r\nstraight down the field. And, Major took almost every snap in the shotgun (=\r\nat=20\r\nleast the first drive). I know it was against an inferior opponent that was=\r\n=20\r\nprobably taken by surprise, but they showed more on those drives with Major=\r\n=20\r\nin the first and second quarter than they have the rest of the season (so=\r\n=20\r\nfar).=20\r\n=09\r\n=09I believe you CAN win in college football with an unbalanced attack. FSU=\r\n has=20\r\ndone it with primarily passing, and I can't begin to name all the OU and=20\r\nNebraska-type teams that have won conference/national titles with=20\r\none-dimensional offenses. Also, the shotgun helps Major's biggest liability=\r\n -=20\r\nhis mobility. Personally, I don't care which QB is used this season - in th=\r\ne=20\r\nshotgun or not, but I really wish Mack Brown would just choose one and stic=\r\nk=20\r\nwith him. =20\r\n=09?? Aaron Ruhnow=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  I think you will continue to see the shotgun used only in speci=\r\nfic=20\r\nsituations. The Texas coaches are too committed to being a balanced offense=\r\n=20\r\nthat can run out of multiple sets. I do like the shotgun. The Buffalo Bills=\r\n=20\r\nused it all the time while they were going to all those Super Bowls. You ca=\r\nn=20\r\ndo a lot with it. But it probably won't become a fixture in Austin.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: Do you think that the pressure and expectations of Texas fans are go=\r\ning=20\r\nto be too much for Mack Brown to handle? It appears he is already crumbling=\r\n.=20\r\nIf he thinks people are hammering him now, what will it be like if he drops=\r\n=20\r\nthis year's game to A=02?and suffers four losses?=20\r\n=09?? Mike McDonald=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  : I hope it won't be too much for Mack Brown. He's a good perso=\r\nn and=20\r\nworks really hard. I think he needs to just let some of this stuff wash ove=\r\nr=20\r\nhim and forget about it. I think he has gotten into a rut lately where he=\r\n=20\r\nsenses that every question has negative overtones. So now he is answering=\r\n=20\r\nevery question by acknowledging his critics with some kind of remark.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09He has done more for Texas than UT will ever know. He has reshaped the=\r\n=20\r\nmindset of the university with the positive outlook he has brought to the=\r\n=20\r\nfootball team. Games are selling out. Players are coming to Austin. The kid=\r\ns,=20\r\nfor the most part, are good kids.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09There's no need for Mack to draw a line in the sand and allow a few nega=\r\ntive=20\r\nvoices to bring him down or cast a shadow over all the progress he has made=\r\n.=20\r\nIf he moves on, the media and the critics will move on, too. If he harps on=\r\n=20\r\ncriticism and keeps bringing it up in his answers, the media has no=20\r\nalternative but to report it. It becomes a wicked circle.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: David Aaron was a receiver that came out of Marshall a few years bac=\r\nk. I=20\r\nknow he also went to UT for track but he was a great receiver in high schoo=\r\nl.=20\r\nI saw him on the sidelines a few times but he never got much playing time. =\r\nI=20\r\nwas thinking he should be a senior this year. Do you know what ever happene=\r\nd=20\r\nto him?=20\r\n=09?? Jeff, Marshall, Texas=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Aaron is just running track this year. He has left the football=\r\n=20\r\nteam.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: Is it just me , or does the football field look a little bit torn up=\r\n? It=20\r\njust looks really dry and during the game a lot of turf gets thrown up.=20\r\n=09?? Mark V.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  UT officials say it's the drought and the fact that the UT team=\r\n=20\r\npractices on the field on Thursdays. But, I agree. I think the field looks=\r\n=20\r\nworse this season than it did last season (and we had a drought and the tea=\r\nm=20\r\npracticed on it last year, too).=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: What is up with all the negative press that Mack Brown and the Horns=\r\n have=20\r\nbeen getting lately? From exercising their right to buy out of the Hawaii=\r\n=20\r\ngame to losing their chance at a national title to running up the score in=\r\n=20\r\nthe U of H game, and finally, to wanting the U of H game moved from a high=\r\n=20\r\nschool stadium to a real college stadium where real fans can see a football=\r\n=20\r\ngame.\r\n=09\r\n=09I'm not sure about Dallas, but here in Houston Mack and Co. have been ge=\r\ntting=20\r\ndrilled for everything I listed above and more (QB rotation). It just seems=\r\n=20\r\nlike everyone in the media, and even some our own fans, want to find=20\r\nsomething negative to heap on the program.\r\n=09\r\n=09In my opinion, Mack and the rest of the team do not deserve this. Mack, =\r\nhis=20\r\ncoaches and the players have been nothing short of genuine and up-front wit=\r\nh=20\r\nthe media and the public. They have expressed confidence, but never boasted=\r\n=20\r\nabout their greatness. In fact, they have been the epitome of humility. Do=\r\n=20\r\nyou have any thoughts as to why this is occurring? Hook 'em. =20\r\n=09?? Marty Murray, Class of '82, Baytown, Texas=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  It does seem to be a ridiculous truth that when we build someth=\r\ning=20\r\nup, we inevitably end up tearing it down. Maybe the sense is that the=20\r\nstorybook season of 1998 and the victory over Nebraska last year built up t=\r\noo=20\r\nbig of expectations. The three losses at the end of last year did nothing t=\r\no=20\r\nburst the bubble and then when UT comes out flat this year, everyone=20\r\nre-evaluated and said, \"Wait, they really aren't that good.\"\r\n=09\r\n=09Mack Brown had been telling people to reduce their expectations. But whe=\r\nn the=20\r\nstar falls, people want to be the first to say it's falling. Then, they wan=\r\nt=20\r\nto add their own wrinkle as to why it's falling. So people look for cracks =\r\nin=20\r\nthe foundation to bring up.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09It's like in political campaigns. The media tends to build up a candidat=\r\ne and=20\r\nthen when the first negative story comes out, they re-evaluate, and if some=\r\n=20\r\nbad trends continue, that candidate gets torn to shreds. It all feeds on=20\r\nitself. But inevitably there is a settling period.\r\n=09\r\n=09I think the people who are quick to say that Texas isn't as good as we=\r\n=20\r\nbelieved will calm down and there will be another story to cover. Plus, Tex=\r\nas=20\r\nmay get hot, win all of its games, and then this brief bout of criticism wi=\r\nll=20\r\nhave been for naught. But sometimes criticism can be good for a coach and h=\r\nis=20\r\nteam. He can use it as bulletin board material to get the team going. We'll=\r\n=20\r\nsee how Mack Brown and the vocal minority of critics handle things from=20\r\nhere. =20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: Do you think Chris Simms would have benefited from a redshirt year? =\r\nI=20\r\nrealize we were thin at quarterback last year and it was probably not an=20\r\noption, but I look back at Major Applewhite and it appears to me he benefit=\r\ned=20\r\nfrom a redshirt year in which his only responsibility was to learn the=20\r\nsystem. When he came in as a redshirt freshman, he was ready to go. Thanks=\r\n=20\r\nfor your insightful newsletter. =20\r\n=09?? Michael R. Johnson, Houston, Texas =20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Sure, I think most players benefit from a redshirt year unless =\r\nthey=20\r\nare Michael Vick. There was no way a redshirt season was going to happen fo=\r\nr=20\r\nSimms, however. Simms wants to spend just four years in college, and UT=20\r\ncoaches needed a backup for Applewhite. There is no question Applewhite=20\r\nbenefited from his redshirt season.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: I'm really sick of all this negative stuff from a vocal minority of=\r\n=20\r\nfair-weather fans. They sound like a bunch of whining Aggies.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09Having said that, I still can't help but wonder if we don't have a probl=\r\nem=20\r\nwith our offensive line coach. According to the UT media guide, Coach Tim=\r\n=20\r\nNunez has had very little experience as an offensive line coach prior to=20\r\ncoming here. He didn't play that position either. There is no track record =\r\nof=20\r\nhaving actually developed a line, since he inherited experienced lines at=\r\n=20\r\nboth Marshall and UT.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09This group clearly hasn't improved, even though it was a major source of=\r\n=20\r\nconcern after last season. Nunez may be a fine coach and a great recruiter,=\r\n=20\r\nbut does anyone think that he is one of the top O-line coaches in the=20\r\ncountry? Is he the one who we want developing the fine group of incoming li=\r\nne=20\r\nrecruits we have committed for next year?=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Patience. Don't fire a coach before it gets to mid-season. If t=\r\nhe=20\r\noffensive line doesn't show any progress by the end of the year, then it's=\r\n=20\r\ntime to talk about whether coaches have done their jobs. Nunez was coaching=\r\n=20\r\nthis line when it beat Nebraska last year, so let's give him some time to=\r\n=20\r\nwork with these guys.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: What's the scoop on playing UH at Robertson Stadium next year? Can T=\r\nexas=20\r\n(a la Hawaii) threaten to cancel the game with Houston unless it is played =\r\nin=20\r\nthe Astrodome or Rice Stadium? Also, how can either school afford to give u=\r\np=20\r\nthe lost revenue that would result from a Robertson Stadium game, even if=\r\n=20\r\nthey do put in an extra 10,000 temporary seats?=20\r\n=09?? Chris Barbee, El Campo, Texas =20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  This is a price Texas will pay for trying to rekindle some semb=\r\nlance=20\r\nof an old Southwest Conference matchup. After UT canceled the Hawaii game, =\r\nI=20\r\ndoubt they will actively seek to change next year's schedule. It will be an=\r\n=20\r\nintimate setting, shall we say.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: I live in Odessa and I use to see Roy Williams do punt returns. Why =\r\nnot=20\r\nlet  him return some punts?=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Mack Brown doesn't like to put freshmen back on punt returns un=\r\ntil=20\r\nat least mid-season. After mid-season, he argues that freshmen aren't=20\r\nfreshmen anymore. So, perhaps after mid-season, if UT is not making any=20\r\nprogress on punt returns, we'll see some new faces back there. I would love=\r\n=20\r\nto see what Williams can do, although I doubt that coaches would put him ba=\r\nck=20\r\nthere. And I would really like to see Nathan Vasher back there. Heck, I wou=\r\nld=20\r\nlike to see Nathan Vasher everywhere. From what I have seen, the kid is=20\r\nfearless with tons of confidence. We'll see.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: Before the UT/Oklahoma State game, I thought that Mack Brown would s=\r\ntart=20\r\nshuffling the quarterbacks less often - giving them a quarter or two instea=\r\nd=20\r\nof two or three series each - in order to begin to establish some sort of=\r\n=20\r\nconsistency. (In your Sept. 25 column, you also said this should happen.) I=\r\nn=20\r\nthe game, Chris Simms started, but was pulled early after an interception,=\r\n=20\r\nand Applewhite played until well into the fourth quarter. The TV announcers=\r\n=20\r\neven wondered aloud if Simms was hurt in some way, since he didn't get back=\r\n =20\r\nin until late in the game.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09My question is: Was this a message to Simms in some way, due to his poor=\r\n=20\r\nearly performance? Or was this somewhat scripted in advance in order to giv=\r\ne=20\r\nApplewhite the reigns? It certainly appears that the coaches have more=20\r\nconfidence in Applewhite based on the situations they put him in. =20\r\n=09?? Rick Highfill. Naperville, Ill.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  I sincerely think that the coaches have been trying to give Sim=\r\nms=20\r\nevery chance to thrive and possibly win the job. After four games, it's cle=\r\nar=20\r\nhe hasn't won the job outright. Now, coaches have to decide if this rotatio=\r\nn=20\r\nis really the best thing for the team and its leadership. I think they will=\r\n=20\r\nrely more on Applewhite in the next two games and thus kind of disprove the=\r\nir=20\r\nown theories about having two starters.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09The hard part about the public relations in this situation is that once =\r\nyou=20\r\nsay you have two starters, it's a real blow to one once you say that you no=\r\nw=20\r\nonly have one starter. I think the coaches will continue to say they have t=\r\nwo=20\r\nstarters and play Simms out of fear of an injury affecting Applewhite. I=20\r\ndon't know if that's the right answer. Applewhite grew on the job without a=\r\nny=20\r\ngame training before Richard Walton went down in 1998. So who knows?=20\r\n=09\r\n=09I would think the coaches will again rotate after the OU and Colorado ga=\r\nmes=20\r\nbecause they will face teams (Missouri, Baylor, Texas Tech and Kansas) that=\r\n=20\r\nthey will probably be favored to beat. At that point, if you're UT, you jus=\r\nt=20\r\nhope that the rotation doesn't hurt the team's offensive progress heading=\r\n=20\r\ninto the A=02?game and post-season.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: Is there a start time for the Colorado game? And will it be on TV?=\r\n=20\r\n=09?? Marcus Phillips=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  The Colorado game will be at 2:30 p.m. Central time on Oct. 14.=\r\n But=20\r\nthe game will NOT be on TV. Not even on pay-per-view. If you want to see th=\r\nis=20\r\none, you gotta get out to Boulder.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 If you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to subscri=\r\nbe,=20\r\nsign up at:   Newsletter Registration=20\r\n=09\r\n=09To find or change your password, modify your account, or unsubscribe fro=\r\nm=20\r\nthis newsletter, go to:   Newsletter Registration =20\r\n=09\r\n=09Questions?

        "body": "Alan - thanks for assembling this information.  It is very useful but I want \nto throw out some ideas for discussion and ask you and others to comment on \nthe direction we take with this.\n\nI think we should characterize the Cost of Takeover as the difference in cost \nbetween the Nationalization approach Davis is taking and Enron's Market \napproach (increase supply, decrease demand, retail competition, utility \nsolvency).   Here's the direction that takes us:\n\n$13 B utility under-recovery:  required in both cases.\n$7.6 purchase of Transmission:  represents a $3.8B excess cost in Davis \nplan.  Ratepayers were going to pay for the first $3.8B anyway.  If Davis \nnets this against the $13 B under-recovery, then it's not an excess cost.\nTransmission upgrades:  required in both cases.\nDSM/DG grants:  required in both cases.\nNew construction to cover short position:  required in both cases.  Cost \ndifference is net difference between private market cost of generation and \nwhat subsidy CA must provide to induce generation at its desired cost, and \nnet inefficiency from administering a govt. bureaucracy vs. free market entry \nand exit.  These will be a function of how 6X is administered.\n\nIn other words, I see the direct and measurable Cost of Takeover now as maybe \n$4-5 B, including $1B to cover court challenges, legal costs, new bureaucracy \nand so on.  Much more important (and perhaps this is where the big $$ can \ncome in) is through indirect costs - damage to California's economy through \nreduced private investment because of heavy-handed govt threat, loss of  \ncommercial and industrial development because of short-term supply shortages, \nand long term inefficiencies because of public instead of private management.\n\nSo how about this:  direct cost of takeover is $5 billion plus a long term, \nindirect cost of $__ B because of a 5% reduction per year in the rate of new \ncapital investment  in the state.  Maybe a Robert Michael or somebody could \nfill in the last blank with a little prodding from us.\n\n\n\n\n\tAlan Comnes@ECT\n\t02/21/2001 01:49 PM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: John Neslage/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, James D \nSteffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan J \nMara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: Re: Cost of Takeover\n\nI already have a few changes:\n\nIn Davis's Feb 08 press release, it states: \"Under Governor Davis' emergency \npowers and proposals, California will streamline efforts to bring an \nadditional 20,000 megawatts online by July 2004, starting with 5,000 \nadditional megawatts by July 2001 and 5,000 more megawatts by July 2002.\"\n\nAlso, he mentions expanding by 1,000 MW the transmission line \"to Oregon\" in \nhis 2/16 press conference transcript.\n\nI have just upped the costs to reflect these numbers.\n\n\n",

O. Box 26530, Austin, Texas 78755 -\nPhone\n512-795-8536\n\nLonghorns Get Pledge from Killeen Ellison Linebacker\n\nYamil LaBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, a middle linebacker from Killeen Ellison,\nannounced his commitment to Texas Monday, giving the Longhorns nine early\ncommitments. The Horns had pulled a big surprise earlier Monday, getting\nMike\nGarcia, a big offensive lineman from Galena Park, to switch from A&M to\nTexas.\nLaBron and  Garcia were the seventh and  eighth high school players to\ncommit\nto Texas this month. In addition, Alfio Randall, a star OT at Blinn JC,\nsays\nhe will come to Texas in January after he graduates from Blinn.\nThe other high school players who have committed to Texas are OLs Jonathan\nScott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, Roman\nReeves\nof Livingston and Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and DBs Braden\nJohnson\nof Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands.\n\"I went to the Texas camp two weeks ago and they offered me a scholarship,\"\nLaBron said Monday night. \"I verbally committed to them when I met with the\ncoaches with my dad. I'm waiting for my mom to come home from Puerto Rico\nso\nshe can talk to them, too. To tell you the truth, I'm going there anyway.\nI'm\ngoing to be a Longhorn.\"\n* * * *\nI talked to Chris Hill, Roy Williams' mother, tonight and she said the\nshoulder injury Roy suffered on the opening kickoff of the Texas-California\nAll-Star game Saturday night, involves stretched ligaments and she said the\ndoctors say it will heal on it own. California won the game, 29-27, on a\n53-yard FG on the final play.\n\"He's in a lot of pain,\" she said. \"It's very sore. We took him to a\nspecialist and the examination showed stretched ligaments in the shoulder.\nThe specialist said it should heal on its own in a few weeks.\"\nShe also said the doctor said he should be fully recovered by the time the\nfreshmen report at Texas in mid-August.\nWilliams, a great wide receiver prospect from Odessa Permian,is one of the\ntop Longhorn recruits. He is 6-3, weighs 208 pounds and he ran a 10.03 100\nmeters last track season. He also high jumped 7-0 and he set a state record\nin the broad jump at the state meet with a  25-6 leap.\nSloan Thomas of Klein, another of the outstanding WR recruits Texas signed\nin\nFebruary, caught five passes in the second half and was one of the key\nplayers who led the Texas team's comeback from a 26-7 deficit. He caught\none\ntouchdown pass and set up two others with outstanding catches in heavy\ntraffic. On the two great catches in traffic, he was behind the secondary,\nbut had to come back because the balls were underthrown. He ran a 10.38 100\nmeters his junior year and, like Williams, has a great combination of size\nand speed. He is 6-2 and weighs almost 200 pounds.\nDE Kalen Thornton of Dallas St. Mark's, another UT signee, split time at\nend\nand tackle and was outstanding at both. He had two sacks and consistently\nput\npressure on the California quarterbacks.\nC Jason Glynn and DT Sonny Davis, the other two UT signees who played in\nthe\ngame, also looked good when they got to play. Glynn opened some good holes\non\nthe late scoring drive that put Texas ahead, 27-26, with just 17 seconds\nleft. Davis appeared to be carrying a little excess weight, but he was able\nto push the Cal blockers back into the backfield at times.\nThis was the second straight year California has won the game in the final\nseconds.\nB. J. Johnson, the nation's No. 1 WR recruit and another Texas signee,\nsprained an ankle a week before the game and was not able to play. He said\nthe ankle sprain is mild and won't hamper his ability to be in good shape\nfor\nthe start of workouts at UT in less than seven weeks.\n* * * *\nRECRUITING NOTES: DT Tommie Harris, LeBron's teammate at Killeen Ellison,\nsays Texas and Florida State are his top two teams right now, followed by\nA&M,\nMiami and UCLA. Harris  probably is the nation's top DT recruit, and he is\na\ngood friend of Greg Barnum, the center who quit the Tennessee team several\nweeks ago and is considering transferring to Texas to continue his football\ncareer.\n* * * *\nMy next fax will be whenever events warrant.\n* * * *\nThe True Orange Fax Service includes  at  least  99 faxes  a year and costs\n$99 ($79 by E-Mail).

There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be \nheld over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC \nmeeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary \ndue to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed \nin this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  \n\nThe December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM \nand EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior \nSpecialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review \nmeetings mirror the \"preferred distribution\", which as you probably know \nsuggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should \ntherefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work \nhas been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not \nbe too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the \nmanagers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good \njumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review \nand rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing \nsuggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I \nstill have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss \nmy suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of \ncourse pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels \nthat we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my \ndirect reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda \nHerod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to \nattend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  \n\nDo you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this \nyear?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the \nyear to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in \nHouston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would \nmake sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.  \n\n   \n\n    -Sally  \n\n\n\nMike Jordan\n11/24/2000 04:28 AM\nTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Cross calibration for Operations people globally\n\nSally\n\nI have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about \nchecking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) \nwhich raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross \ncalibration done by yourself. Can I ask what are the plans?\n\n\n\n",

Box 26530, Austin, Texas 78755 -\nPhone\n512-795-8536\n\nFour Longhorn Substitutes Leaving Team; UT Will Sign at Least 22\n\nThree Longhorn reserves\n\n- sophomore CB Kendrick Turner, sophomore LB Jamal\nJoyner and redshirt freshman DB Antonio Moore\n- have quit the football team\nand will transfer to other schools, and a fourth backup\n- redshirt freshman\nFB Jason Barron\n- will miss the 2000 season for academic reasons.\nBarron said he will work to improve his grades and return to the team, but\nI\nwould be surprised if he comes back because he is far down on the fullback\nchart and the Longhorns probably will sign at least 22 players in February.\nWith 80 players on scholarship and only 13 seniors, they will need to have\nsome more players leave next year to stay within the NCAA's 85-scholarship\nlimit.\nNone of the departures came as a surprise and Turner was the only one of\nthe\nquartet who would have seen any meaningful action this season if he had\nstayed. Joyner was on suspension. He was the last to leave of the four\nplayers who were suspended prior to the Cotton Bowl game.\nBrown wished all of the young men well, and gave the three who are\ntransferring unconditional releases.\n* * * *\nEric Hall, 6-3, 235, 4.5, the outstanding DE prospect from Clarksville,\nTenn., told me today he is going to take his official visit to Texas the\nSept. 9 weekend and will see the season-opening game against\nLouisiana-Lafayette. He said he strongly favors Texas, and the only other\nschools he is considering are Nebraska and Tennessee.\n\"I see myself going to Texas,\" he said. \"I was born in Texas (Fort Hood)\nand\nI really like the state.\"\nAnother top out-of-state DE who is strongly considering Texas is Kaelen\nJakes,  6-4, 265, 4.8 of Valencia, Cal. He lived in Texas for  four years\nand\nsaid he is considering the Horns, along with USC, UCLA, Arizona and\nNebraska.\nHe said his team doesn't keep invidual stats, but estimated he had \"between\n15\nand 18 sacks last season.\" He said he played DE, DT and NG for Valencia\nlast\nyear.\n* * * *\nDT Tommie Harris of Killen Ellison is the top DL in Texas this year and is\none of the top players in the country. He says he favors Texas over Florida\nState and others. Harris has been working out in Houston with a personal\ntrainer this summer. UT center signee Trey Bates works out with the same\ntrainer. Stockar McDougle, a former Oklahoma Sooner OL who now is in the\nNFL,\nis Harris' cousin, and is paying for the personal trainer for Harris.\n* * * *\nTexas has 11 early commitments, including six offensive linemen. The OLs\nare\nMike Garcia of Galena Park (who switched from A&M to Texas), Jonathan Scott\nof Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, Roman Reeves of\nLivingston, Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and Alfio Randall of Blinn\nJC.\nScott and Robinson are national top 100 players and Randall was a top 100\nplayer at Houston Yates two years ago. The other pledges are QB/DB Kendal\nBriles of Frenship, MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison, and DBs Cedric\nGriffin of San Antonio Holmes, Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian\nCarter of The Woodlands.\nTen players who signed with Texas are slated to play in the annual\nNorth-South High School Football All-Star game at Rice Stadium next Tuesday\nat 7 p.m. Scheduled to play for the North are QBs Chance Mock of The\nWoodlands and Tony Jeffery of Klein Forest, WRs Roy Williams of Odessa\nPermian, B. J. Johnson of South Grand Prairie and Nathan Vasher of\nTexarkana\nand kicker Matt McFadden of Coppell.\nScheduled to play for the South are OT Lionel Garr of Diboll, C Trey Bates\nof\nFort Bend Elkins and DTs Sonny Davis of Austin Lanier and Marcel Moses of\nTexas City. Davis and Moses failed to qualify academically and are headed\nto\nthe JC ranks. Johnson has a sprained ankle that will keep him out of the\ngame.\n* * * *\nFOOTBALL NOTES: The Longhorn DBs are extremely impressed with Sloan Thomas\nand Tony Jeffery, who are two of the outstanding incoming freshman wide\nreceiver prospects. They said Thomas is a big, physical receiver with great\nspeed, and they say Jeffery is very hard to cover because he has such great\nmoves and quickness. The players have been working out against each other\nduring voluntary summer drills.\n* * * *\nWOMEN'S BASKETBALL RECRUITING: CoCo Reed, a 5-11 forward from Houston\nJersey\nVillage, has committed to play for the Texas women. She averaged 19 points\nas\na junior and averaged 23 points in AAU play this summer. She lives with 5-6\njunior point guard Nina Norman, who will be one of the nation's top\nprospects\nnext year. Reed also was recruited by Duke, LSU, Rutgers, Florida and\nMaryland, among others.\nThe Longhorn women's top incoming freshmen\n- 6-1 Stacy Stephens of Winnsboro\nand 6-2 Annissa Hastings of San Antonio Sam Houston\n- were named to the AAU\nAll-American Team Saturday at the conclusion of the National AAU Tournament\nin Clarksville, Tenn.\n* * * *\nMy next fax will be whenever events warrant.\n* * * *\nThe True Orange Fax Service includes  at  least  99 faxes  a year and costs\n$99 ($79 by E-Mail).

O. Box 26530, Austin, Texas 78755 -\nPhone\n512-795-8536\n\nRoy Williams Leads Outstanding Freshman Class in Workouts\nThe heralded Longhorn freshman class had its first two workouts Monday, and\nseveral players looked very good, but big, fast WR Roy Williams was almost\ntoo impressive to believe.\nHe's big, at about 6-3 or maybe 6-4 and a little over 200 pounds (we should\nget official heights and weights Tuesday) and he is fast (10.03 100 meters\nlast track season) and no one could cover him Monday. He caught so many\nlong\npasses I lost count.\nPitty poor Nathan Vasher, the lone scholarship DB among the freshmen. He\nhad\nto try to cover Williams, B. J. Johnson, Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery, the\nbest group of freshman wide receivers in the country. As soon as he got\nthrough with one and got a little breather, it was on to the next one.\nVasher\nactually did a good job most of the time on everybody except Williams, who\nwas just too big and too strong for him to handle. Vasher does a good job\nof\nman coverage, getting right with the wide receiver and staying with him on\nmost occasions.\nAlso pity poor QB Chance Mock, who probably threw more passes Monday than\nhe\ndid in his whole career at The Woodlands. He showed great accuracy and\ntouch\non long and short passes, and offensive coordinator Greg Davis,\ncomplimented\nhim for having \"a quick release.\" But I'll bet his arm is sore Tuesday.\nCoach Mack Brown said he doesn't normally want to play freshmen,\nparticularly\nearly in the season, but he said it is easier for wide receivers to play\nearly than for most other players.\n\"Take our two freshmen defensive ends, Kalen Thornon and Adam Doiron,\"\nBrown\nsaid. \"They are very good prospects, but they have never lined up against\nanybody like Leonard Davis, and that's what they'll start doing when the\nveterans show up. Their learning curve goes up pretty drastically, and they\nprobably will need some time to cope with that.\"\nBut he said it's a different story with wide receivers. \"If a receiver can\nrun, jump, catch and do something after he catches it, Brown said, \"we can\nmake the offense simpler for him,\"\nDarryl Drake, the wide receiver coach, phrased it another way, saying, \"If\na\nguy is 6-3 or 6-4, can run close to a 10-flat hundred meters and high jump\nseven feet (Williams did all that last year at Odessa Permian), we'll just\ntell him to run down the field and, if anybody can keep up with him,\nthey're\nprobably short cornerbacks and he can outjump them for the ball. We'll\ncoach\nhim next year, but he can get by with the speed and jumping ability this\nyear.\" Drake was only partially kidding.\nWhen Williams has to try to get off the line against big-time correrbacks\nlike Quentin Jammer and Roderick Babers, the two UT starters, it will be\nharder, but Brown said all the receivers are going to get a lot of work\nagainst bump-and-run coverage. He also said he expects at least two of them\nto play a lot early in the season;\nThomas, Johnson and Jeffery also had some good plays. Thomas made one great\ncatch of a high ball that appeared to be out of his reach.\nOne UT assistant coach told me today he has never seen back-to-back classes\nas outstanding as the two the Longhorns have put together the last two\nyears.\nThe freshmen will have their final workouts as a group Tuesday. The varsity\nreports Wednesday and the first full team workouts will be Friday.\n* * * *\nRECRUITING NOTES: The news got as little better today on the state's best\nquarterback, Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 217, 4.62, of Dallas Bishop Lynch. He\nvisited Colorado unofficially last weekend and came back very impressed and\nsaying he wants to delay his decision on picking a college.\nBut he told me today the Longhorn coaches are recruiting two quarterbacks\n(Bret Rawls of Louisiana powerhouse Shreveport Evangel is the other one)\n\"and\nthey gave us both a deadline of October 15 and told us to look around and\nbe\nsure what we want to do. I think that is a real sign of class,\" he said.\n\"I'll probably take some official visits before that, maybe to Colorado,\nKansas, LSU and Tennessee, and then I'll take an official visit to Texas. I\nstill say Texas will be hard to beat, but I just want to be real sure\nbefore\nI make a decision.\"\n* * * *\nMy next fax will be Tuesday, August 15.\n* * * *\nThe True Orange Fax Service includes  at  least  99 faxes  a year and costs\n$99 ($79 by E-Mail).

That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the pa=\r\nst=20\r\n17 years - usually before Texas-OU weekend. =20\r\n=09\r\n=09 Orangebloods spend winter, spring and summer discussing the impact of n=\r\new=20\r\nrecruits, the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning=\r\n=20\r\nstarters. They spend money on season tickets, airplane tickets and alumni=\r\n=20\r\nluncheon tickets. They dream big dreams, and then by October, the high hope=\r\ns=20\r\nhave usually come crashing down.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 Only three times since 1983 has Texas opened the season 3-0: 1984, 1985=\r\n and=20\r\n1994. Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie (1984) or=\r\n=20\r\nlosses (1985 and 1994). In each of those seasons, Texas ended up with four=\r\n=20\r\nlosses. =20\r\n=09\r\n=09 In UT's two best seasons since 1983, a 10-2 campaign in 1990 and a 10-2=\r\n-1=20\r\nrun in 1995, the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season,=\r\n=20\r\nrespectively. Before Texas can dream about winning a national title, the=20\r\nLonghorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09=20\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09Longhorn Q & A=20\r\n=09 Q: Judging from the Stanford game (as well as the last three games of l=\r\nast=20\r\nseason) it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue. There =\r\nis=20\r\nalso no respect for our running game from any team that we face. I think th=\r\ne=20\r\nbest way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on=20\r\noffense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving=\r\n=20\r\nus. =20\r\n=09\r\n=09In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our b=\r\nest=20\r\nathletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experience=\r\nd=20\r\nplayers, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the=\r\n=20\r\nability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to sta=\r\nrt=20\r\nRoy Williams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrell Flowers) and=\r\n=20\r\nplay a one-back offensive set. Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a=\r\nnd=20\r\nHodges Mitchell is not an I-back who is adept at following the fullback=20\r\nthrough the hole. Hodges' strength is operating in space and making people=\r\n=20\r\nmiss in the open field.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter=\r\nback.=20\r\nMajor Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could (and=\r\n=20\r\nprobably does) possess all of the same skills. He just hasn't had the chanc=\r\ne=20\r\nto display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if=\r\n=20\r\nwe are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could see this season=20\r\nslipping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?=20\r\n=09 ?? The Jackson residence=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  With any unexpected loss, the tendency is to throw everyone out=\r\n -=20\r\nchange coaches, players, even the bus driver. You do that and you are telli=\r\nng=20\r\nthis team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be to=\r\no=20\r\nmuch change at any one time. The big question is how the team responds to=\r\n=20\r\nthis Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some=\r\n=20\r\nresolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all=\r\n=20\r\nthe positions where problems currently exist. In 1996, Texas was No. 6 and=\r\n=20\r\nNotre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT th=\r\nen=20\r\nlost three of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,=\r\n=20\r\nOklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's=\r\n=20\r\nopponent, Houston.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread =\r\nwas=20\r\nthat Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its=\r\n=20\r\nloss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv=\r\ne=20\r\nto show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20\r\ncould go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha=\r\nrd=20\r\nteam to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor=\r\nns=20\r\nare not a very good football team right now. The challenge has been made to=\r\n=20\r\nhis team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position will b=\r\ne=20\r\nscrutinized, every coach, even the bus driver. There will be enough fire=20\r\nbeing thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state. Bu=\r\nt=20\r\nchanges will have to be made constructively and gradually.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09[IMAGE]=20\r\n=09Chris Simms =20\r\n=09\r\n=09Q: What's going on with the quarterbacks?=20\r\n=09?? Mitch Golding=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  As the QBs turn. This week, it appears Chris Simms will start=\r\n=20\r\nbecause he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the=\r\n=20\r\ntrend. Whoever practices with the first team gets the start. Anyway, we'll=\r\n=20\r\nsee how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Applewhite was erratic =\r\nin=20\r\nhis play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a=20\r\nmiraculous victory. I'm sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see=\r\n=20\r\nwhat Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other =20\r\n=09\r\n=09to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games. =20\r\n=09\r\n=09Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mac=\r\nk=20\r\nBrown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of=\r\n=20\r\nhis experience and the fact that it was the team's first game on the road. =\r\nHe=20\r\nsaid they still have all the faith in the world in Simms. It would seem to =\r\nme=20\r\nthat it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense, lig=\r\nht=20\r\nit up and get on a roll when you are alternating, but I'll continue to watc=\r\nh=20\r\nlike everyone else. =20\r\n=09\r\n=09I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli=\r\nna=20\r\nwith success. Of course, with those QBs (Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf)=\r\n,=20\r\nBrown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t=\r\no=20\r\nprepare for Davenport's scrambling and Keldorf's passing. With Simms and=20\r\nApplewhite you pretty much get the same style. With Keldorf and Davenport,=\r\n=20\r\nyou also had injuries dictate a few starts.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: Can you tell us what influenced Mack Brown's decision regarding the=\r\n=20\r\nquarterbacks against Stanford?=20\r\n=09?? Nels Marshall=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Here are Brown's exact words: \"Experience. We were in a tight=\r\n=20\r\nfootball game and Major (Applewhite) has been around a long time. I was pro=\r\nud=20\r\n- even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter - that =\r\nwe=20\r\ndidn't panic. I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job=\r\n=20\r\nof coming back and giving us a chance to win. Sometimes youth doesn't look=\r\n=20\r\nlike it is trying because they're nervous. Instead, they are trying too har=\r\nd=20\r\nand get uptight. Our team tried hard. As negative as people make Saturday=\r\n=20\r\nnight, it is one of those things that you have to grow from.\" =20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: I'm glad we have two great QBs. My question is, are the receivers ha=\r\nving=20\r\nany problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a=20\r\nleft-handed or right-handed QB?=20\r\n=09?? Dave Stastny, Austin=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch=\r\ning=20\r\nthe ball. They do, however, say that Chris Simms' ball will come a little=\r\n=20\r\nfaster and a little harder than Major Applewhite's.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea=\r\nr.=20\r\nWhat are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts? I know=\r\n=20\r\nthat a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons, but can they al=\r\nso=20\r\napply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount =\r\nof=20\r\ntime? =20\r\n=09?? Chad Graham=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  No. Once a freshman plays in a game, even for one play and he d=\r\noes=20\r\nnot suffer a season-ending injury, the chance for a redshirt is out the=20\r\nwindow. =20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09[IMAGE]=20\r\n=09Jermain Anderson =20\r\n=09\r\n=09Q: Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b=\r\nack=20\r\nto linebacker? If I remember correctly, he played LB in high school at Texa=\r\ns=20\r\nCity. He seems to still have good speed, but also a problem putting on the=\r\n=20\r\nnecessary weight to play defensive end. It just seems like he might be bett=\r\ner=20\r\nsuited for the outside linebacker rotation, especially considering the=20\r\nprogress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton, Cole Pittman and=\r\n=20\r\nAdam Doiron. =20\r\n=09 ?? Micah Hurt=20\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Coaches don't think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker. =\r\nThey=20\r\nare pleased with the depth at linebacker, as well. They like Anderson's=20\r\ninstincts as a pass rusher. They are still working on his ability to stop t=\r\nhe=20\r\nrun.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn=\r\n=20\r\nfootball schedule in your letter each week. My husband, Mark, is a diehard=\r\n=20\r\nTexan who was transferred to Oklahoma in 1972. Through thick and thin, he h=\r\nas=20\r\nremained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner=\r\n=20\r\nfans. Of course, he does his fair share (and probably more) of bragging abo=\r\nut=20\r\nthe Longhorns. =20\r\n=09?? Barbara and Mark Harper=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  As far as the schedule, UT's remaining games are:=20\r\n=09\r\n=09Sept. 23 (home) vs. Houston at 6 p.m. on Fox\r\n=09Sept. 30 (home) vs. Oklahoma State at 11 a.m. on ABC\r\n=09Oct. 7 (in Dallas) vs. Oklahoma, TBA\r\n=09Oct. 14 at Colorado, TBA\r\n=09Oct. 21 (home) vs. Missouri, TBA\r\n=09Oct. 28 (home) vs. Baylor, TBA\r\n=09Nov. 4 at Texas Tech, TBA\r\n=09Nov. 11 at Kansas, TBA\r\n=09Nov. 24 (home) vs. Texas A=02?at 2:30 p.m. on ABC=20\r\n=09Since you all have access to the Internet, log onto UT's sports Web site=\r\n=20\r\n(texassports.com) and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your=\r\n=20\r\narea. And you can read The Dallas Morning News online every day at=20\r\ndallasnews.com.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: This may take some research but I was wondering if you could tell me=\r\n the=20\r\nnumber of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads (i.e.=\r\n=20\r\nhow's Cedric Woodard, Aaron Humphrey, Kwame Cavil). Thanks.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  The Big 12 office just released a list of former Texas players =\r\nin=20\r\nthe NFL. However, it includes some players who have been released. For=20\r\nexample, Aaron Humphrey was released after a free-agent tryout with Tampa=\r\n=20\r\nBay. Chris Smith was released after a free-agent tryout with Washington and=\r\n=20\r\nDallas. Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota=20\r\nVikings. Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted. Anyway,=\r\n=20\r\nhere is the list as provided by the Big 12:\r\n=09\r\n=09TEXAS (21)\r\n=09Ben Adams, OL, Miami\r\n=09Taje Allen, DB, St. Louis\r\n=09Tony Brackens, DE, Jacksonville\r\n=09Blake Brockermeyer, OG, Chicago\r\n=09Ricky Brown, RB, Cincinnati\r\n=09Chris Carter, DB, New England\r\n=09Kwame Cavil, WR, Buffalo\r\n=09Phil Dawson, KS, Cleveland\r\n=09Shane Dronett, DL, Atlanta\r\n=09Priest Holmes, RB, Baltimore\r\n=09Aaron Humphrey, DE, Tampa Bay\r\n=09Jay Humphrey, OL, Minnesota\r\n=09Derek Lewis, TE, St. Louis\r\n=09Wane McGarity, WR, Dallas\r\n=09Eric Metcalf, WR, Carolina\r\n=09Dan Neil, OL, Denver\r\n=09Roger Roesler, OL, Cincinnati\r\n=09Chris Smith, TE, Dallas\r\n=09Winfred Tubbs, LB, San Francisco\r\n=09Bryant Westbrook, DB, Detroit\r\n=09Ricky Williams, RB, New Orleans\r\n=09Cedric Woodard, DL, Baltimore=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09[IMAGE]=20\r\n=09Hodges Mitchell =20\r\n=09\r\n=09Q: Don't know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y=\r\nour=20\r\ncolumn, but I've seen some unflattering trends in Mack Brown's program and=\r\n=20\r\nwanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.=\r\n=20\r\nHowever, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team \"up\" sometime=\r\ns=20\r\nand can't adjust the team's mood during a game.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible =\r\nfor=20\r\nthe offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than on=\r\ne,=20\r\nI put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges=\r\n=20\r\nMitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis=\r\n=20\r\nlove Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,300-plus yards last year, but how many of=\r\n=20\r\nthose yards were \"move=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 the chains\" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground=\r\n and=20\r\nprotect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but=\r\n=20\r\nall we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th=\r\ne=20\r\nrun and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive=\r\n=20\r\ntackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t=\r\nhe=20\r\nlinebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there=\r\n=20\r\nwith Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a=\r\n=20\r\nreceiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.\r\n=09\r\n=09Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY tim=\r\ne=20\r\nagainst Stanford. I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury=\r\n=20\r\nmay have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up=\r\n=20\r\nwith opponent's wideouts.\r\n=09\r\n=09How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were=\r\n all=20\r\nover the field against Stanford, but the DEs didn't make much noise. What i=\r\ns=20\r\nup with the blocked punts? UT should be really, really embarrassed. Does=20\r\nStockton take too long? Is he too close to the line? Can the line block? Ca=\r\nn=20\r\nanyone at UT block?\r\n=09\r\n=09Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls? Several tim=\r\nes=20\r\nthe camera caught clear holds by Stanford's line. Why on earth would you ru=\r\nn=20\r\nup the middle, on your own goal line against two of the best DTs you'll pla=\r\ny=20\r\nagainst?=20\r\n=09?? Andrew Bowen=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are=20\r\nincredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday=\r\n's=20\r\nevents. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat=\r\n=20\r\nthe team up for not being able to run the ball. But he said to jump on any=\r\n=20\r\nother part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still=20\r\nlearning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a=\r\nnd=20\r\nneeded time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20\r\nfullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probabl=\r\ny=20\r\nisn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di=\r\nd=20\r\nbeat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas A=02?once. If a trend develop=\r\ns,=20\r\nand Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question=\r\n=20\r\nabout whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his team's head screwe=\r\nd=20\r\non straight. But it's typical after losses to want to shred every part of t=\r\nhe=20\r\nteam.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the=\r\n=20\r\nquarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still=\r\n=20\r\nworking hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'=\r\ns=20\r\nno question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are=\r\n=20\r\nthe receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the=\r\n=20\r\nline. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20\r\nApplewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.=\r\n=20\r\n=09\r\n=09Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it =\r\nwas=20\r\ntaking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about=\r\n=20\r\nthat. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20\r\ndeep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20\r\nblitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20\r\nHayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in=\r\n=20\r\ngames after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.=\r\n=20\r\nThe defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl=\r\n=20\r\nReese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl=\r\ne=20\r\nwho can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. B=\r\nut=20\r\nthat position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because=\r\n=20\r\none player, who blocked perfectly on 11 other punts Saturday night, failed =\r\nto=20\r\nblock a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That play=\r\ner=20\r\nhas been chewed out every which way.\r\n=09\r\n=09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow=\r\nn,=20\r\nwho did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa=\r\ny=20\r\nanything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still=\r\n=20\r\nhave a good season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so=\r\n=20\r\nearly will help in that direction. We'll see if Texas takes this loss=20\r\nconstructively or destructively.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding=\r\n. I=20\r\nknow he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player =\r\nin=20\r\nthe country in 1998. I've waited all off-season to see him explode against=\r\n=20\r\nteams this year. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe this week against Stanford. M=\r\ny=20\r\nquestion is, why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker=\r\n=20\r\nwhere he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized=\r\n=20\r\nand average? Is Texas that low on defensive line talent? It seems our=20\r\nrecruiting has been great. Please help me understand. Hook 'em Horns!=20\r\n=09?? Ernie McAnally=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov=\r\ne.=20\r\nBut he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel=\r\nd=20\r\nright away as a defensive end. Coaches also feel that his body (6-5, 260) i=\r\ns=20\r\nperfect for the DE position. He's tall, athletic, fast and has long arms. I=\r\nn=20\r\ntime, coaches feel Redding will develop into an All-America player. But the=\r\nre=20\r\nis no question that he has struggled against the run. He made some big play=\r\ns=20\r\nagainst Stanford, recording six tackles, three of them for losses and=20\r\nblocking an extra point attempt. He is just a sophomore. Over this season a=\r\nnd=20\r\nthe next two years, he should only get better.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the=\r\n=20\r\nannouncers  stated that TCU had anted up $90,000 for the Heisman campaign f=\r\nor=20\r\nLaDainian Tomlinson. How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky=20\r\nWilliams' run for the Heisman?=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Texas didn't spend that much money at all. They produced a few=\r\n=20\r\npostcards, a video and a CD-ROM screen saver to send out to the national=20\r\nmedia detailing Ricky's accomplishments. But those costs totaled less than=\r\n=20\r\n$10,000, according to UT officials.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: Did any of the freshman who did not play in the Louisiana-Lafayette =\r\ngame=20\r\nplay in the Stanford game? I am watching to see which ones might be=20\r\nredshirts. =20\r\n=09?? Mike Smith, Houston=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  According to the participation chart provided at the Stanford-T=\r\nexas=20\r\ngame, Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal wh=\r\no=20\r\ndid not play against Louisiana-Lafayette. In addition to Sendlein, here are=\r\n=20\r\nthe other freshmen who have played so far: WRs Roy Williams, B.J. Johnson a=\r\nnd=20\r\nSloan Thomas; TE Brock Edwards; DE Kalen Thornton; CB Nathan Vasher; FS=20\r\nPhillip Geiggar; and DT Stevie Lee.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: Is it true that in Mack Brown's four or five head coaching stops, hi=\r\ns=20\r\nteams have yet to win a single conference championship? Since UT has lost=\r\n=20\r\nfour out of its last five games, wouldn't a loss to Houston this week=20\r\nofficially end Mack Brown's honeymoon with the alumni, notwithstanding his=\r\n=20\r\nabundant PR program? With Brown about to land his third national Top 5=20\r\nrecruiting class, I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie=\r\ns=20\r\nto go with those recruiting victories. =20\r\n=09?? T. Hough=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  It's true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i=\r\nn=20\r\nstints at Appalachian State, Tulane, North Carolina and now Texas. At=20\r\nAppalachian State, Tulane and UNC, he was taking over absolutely dead=20\r\nprograms. He took Tulane to a bowl, and he had Florida State to deal with i=\r\nn=20\r\nthe Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC. But he took UNC to six bowl gam=\r\nes=20\r\nin his 10 years at UNC and won four of them.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas=20\r\nfaithful. But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot=\r\n=20\r\nseat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha=\r\ns=20\r\ndone beating Nebraska (twice), Oklahoma (twice) and Texas A=02?(once) in hi=\r\ns=20\r\nfirst two seasons here. He has also turned Texas back into a destination=20\r\nschool for top recruits and brought the UT community back together. In=20\r\naddition to all that, he has done more good for UT out of the limelight tha=\r\nn=20\r\nprobably most Texas fans realize.=20\r\n=09\r\n=09Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden, John Cooper, Lloyd C=\r\narr,=20\r\nSteve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer. Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t=\r\nhe=20\r\neyes of fans. It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha=\r\nt.=20\r\nUNC fans were pretty ho-hum about everything the Tar Heels did in football,=\r\n=20\r\neven when they won big. Brown wanted to win at a school with huge=20\r\nexpectations. He'll have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starti=\r\nng=20\r\nout the next few seasons in the Top 10.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: Is Lee Jackson out for the Houston game?=20\r\n=09?? Marty Bonner=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffe=\r\nred=20\r\nagainst Stanford. He may also miss the Oklahoma State game. Mack Brown said=\r\n=20\r\nthis is a bad week to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the ball=\r\n=20\r\nreally well.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: Is Ricky Williams' jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game S=\r\nept.=20\r\n30?=20\r\n=09?? Mark Wilson=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Yes. Williams' No. 34 will be retired at that game. Williams ha=\r\ns=20\r\nsaid he will be there because the New Orleans Saints are off that weekend.=\r\n=20\r\nHost Communications has also just finished a video biography on Williams th=\r\nat=20\r\nwill be available soon.=20\r\n=09?\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 Q: What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrounding his team =\r\nafter=20\r\nthe loss to Stanford?=20\r\n=09?? Virginia Blair=20\r\n=09\r\n=09 BROWN:  Again, here are Mack's words: \"I said during the pre-season tha=\r\nt we=20\r\nwere overrated. I didn't see any reason with the youth, the way we finished=\r\n=20\r\nlast year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a=\r\n=20\r\nTop 5 football team. One of the great things about Texas is that you receiv=\r\ne=20\r\na tremendous amount of attention and publicity, but in some cases people wa=\r\nnt=20\r\nto push you too fast to get to the top. I think that we were in that positi=\r\non=20\r\nand expectations got out of hand. I knew that we would have a difficult gam=\r\ne=20\r\nat Stanford and that it would be a tough game to win. I also didn't think=\r\n=20\r\nthat we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country. Our current rank within=\r\n=20\r\nthe Top 15 is much more fitting for where we are today.\" =20\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09 If you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to subscri=\r\nbe,=20\r\nsign up at:   Newsletter Registration=20\r\n=09\r\n=09To find or change your password, modify your account, or unsubscribe fro=\r\nm=20\r\nthis newsletter, go to:   Newsletter Registration =20\r\n=09\r\n=09Questions?

        "body": "Part 3\n\nRecruiting Roundup\n\nToday (Monday) was the day the Longhorn coaches could start another big\nrecruiting push by going to top recruits' schools and homes, but the big game\nSaturday has pushed that back a week.\nBut don't worry about it. Coach Mack Brown wrote the book on recruiting and\nhis previous four classes at Texas have been very good, and some of them have\nbeen great.\nThis year's class has a chance to be as good as any Brown and his assistants\nhave signed. There's a chance it could be the best of the bunch, even better\nthan the top-rated Chris Simms, Cory Redding class.\nThey already have 16 commitments, about half of them from players who have\nbeen on at least one national top 100 list, and their class already is ranked\nas one of the top five in the nation.\nLet's take a look at where they are and where they are going:\nOFFENSE\nQuarterback\nUT has a commitment from Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar, who is a lot\nbetter than most of the gurus think, and the Horns have close to a 50-50 shot\nat Vincent Young, the wonder kid at Houston Madison, who had his usual game\nFriday for the undefeated Marlins, doing everything on offense and even\nrunning an interception back for a touchdown. (Yes, he plays defense, too,\nwhen needed.)\nRunning Back\nThe Horns have a commitment from Clint Haney of unbeaten Smithson Valley and\nare in the hunt for power-runner deluxe Albert Hardy of Galena Park and\nelusive Selvin Young of Jersey Village. They have an outside shot at Lorenzo\nBooker of Ventura, Cal., the nation's highest rated running back.\nTight End\nDavid Thomas of Wolfforth Frenship, a national top 100 player on some lists,\nis already committed. He is very good. The only other TE the Horns are\nrecruiting is Eric Winston, the humongous pass catcher and blocker deluxe at\nMidland Lee.\nWide Receiver\nNational top 100 star Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Ill., and Dustin Miksch\nof Round Rock Westwood are already committed. Robert Timmons of Flower Mound\nMarcus, a supremely talented player who has little playing experience because\nof transfer problems, is a possibility, and, if the Horns don't get him, they\nmight wind up with Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls or Anthony Wright of Klein\nForest.\nLine\nThe Horns already have a pledge from Neale Tweedie of Allen, a great pass\nblocker who is on several national top 100 lists, and from Brett Valdez of\nBrownwood, a tremendous run blocker.\nThey are still recruiting Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony Ugoh of\nSpring Westfield. Blalock is the best run blocker I've seen this year.\nDEFENSE\nEnd\nChase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel, a national top 100 player, has committed\nand will enroll in January and go through spring training, which will give\nhim a chance to see action as a true freshman. The Longhorns are in the hunt\nfor Bryan Pickryl of Jenks, Okla., a speed rusher deluxe, Larry Dibbles of\nLancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands. All three are on every national\ntop 100 list I've seen.\nTackle\nTexas has commitments from four top tackles - Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast\nCommunity College, a JC in Mississippi, Earl Anderson of San Marcos, Lyle\nSendlein of Scottsdale Chapaparral and Tully Jantzen of Keller. Davis has\nsome academic issues. Sendlein also is a very good offensive lineman and\nJantzen is swift enough to play end. Texas has a very good shot at Rodrique Wr\night of Alief Hastings, the nation's top DT, and at Marco Martin of Mesquite,\nanother national top 100 player. Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo, who\nexcels at DT and OG, also is a strong possibility. It's 50-50 on whether he\nwill play offense or defense in college. He is the son of David Studdard, a\nformer UT offensive line star who had a long career with the Denver Broncos.\nLinebacker\nTexas starts three seniors and needs a great group. Garnet Smith of Arlington\nLamar, Brian Robison of of Splendora and Marcus Myers of Pflugerville are\nalready committed and the Horns are still recruiting several top one from\nTexas and across the country. A. J. Nicholson of Winston Salem, N. C., and\nAaron Thomas of North Mesquite are national top 100 middle backers who are\nstrongly considering Texas, and Michael Williams of Lindale and Rufus\nAlexander of Baton Rouge Christian Life, are fast outside backers the Horns\nare recruiting. Another possibility is Lance Mitchell a top JC linebacker in\nCalifornia who ir orignally from Dallas. He is considering taking a visit.\nDefensive Backs\nMatt Melton, a hard-hitting safety from Tyler, is already committed. Swift\nEdorian McCullough of North Garland, the Class 5A 100 meter champ, also is\nconsidering Texas, along with Brodney Pool, a big, fast safety from Houston\nWestbury.\nKicker\nTexas is looking for a kicker, but has not homed in on one yet. The coaches\nwant someone who can kick off into the end zone consistently.\n\nLonghorn Basketball Adds Pair\n\nTwotop basketball recruits have signed with Texas, head coach Rick Barnes has\nannounced.\nBrad Buckman, a 6-9, 235-pound forward from Austin Westlake, and Kenton\nPaulino, 6-2, 165, a com bo guard from  Los Angeles Fremond HS who will play\nfor Maine Central Institute this season, are the new signees.\n\"Signing Brad and Kenton is another sign that our program is really on the\nrise,\" Barnes said.  \"Both have great athleticism and an attitude of winning\nabout them that we need to continue to bring to The University of Texas.\"\nBuckman plays for coach Clifton McNeely is at Westlake and is a national top\n30 recruit.\nThe No. 2 high school prospect in  Texas according to Mike Kunstadt's Texas\nHoops, Buckman averaged 19.8 points, 10.4 rebounds and 4.3 blocks per game\nduring his junior season.\nHe also is tabbed the No. 15 prospect in the nation by Clark Francis' Hoop\nScoop.  Buckman earned Most Outstanding Player honors at the prestigious\nPitt3 Five-Star Camp this July in Pittsburgh, Pa.\n\"There's not a program in the nation that did not go after Brad during the\nrecruiting period, so to come out on top in that battle is a huge win for\nus,\" Barnes said.\n\"Brad turned down four of the most storied programs in college basketball\nhistory for the opportunity to play at Texas.\" Barnes said.\n\"He made one of the biggest jumps in his game that I have seen during the\nsummer camp period.\nBrad has a tremendous competitive fire and is one of those players that fans\nhere will really appreciate.\"\nPaulino plays under coach Carl Hendrickson at Maine Central.  He starred at\nFremont High School under coach Sam Sullivan, where he averaged 24 points a\ngame and earned Los Angeles Co-Player of the Year accolades during his senior\ncampaign.\n\"Kenton is one of those explosive scoring guards that we need in our\nprogram,\" Barnes said.\n\"He is a very good shooter with range and an exceptional athlete who\nhigh-jumped 6-10 in high school. Kenton is the complete guard we were looking\nfor.\"\n\nHorns Sign 2 in Softball\n\nTexas softball coach Connie Clark has signed centerfielder Tina Boutelle of\nKaty Taylor and second baseman Chezare Sievers of Aliso Niguel HS in Mission\nViejo, Calif.\n\"We are excited about signing two of the top recruits in the country,\" Clark\nsaid. \"Tina and Chezare will be immediate impact players for us. We only lose\ntwo players to graduation in the spring of 2002 and are pleased to have Tina\nand Chezare as our newest additions to the softball program.\"\nBoutelle, a 5-5 left-handed hitter, was named first team All-American as a\njunior while helping her team to a 31-4 record and a second-place finish at\nthe Texas 5A State Championship.\nShe also is an All-District and All-Greater Houston selection. She was named\nto the Texas Girls Coaches Association All-State Team and first team Academic\nAll-District in 2000.\nBoutelle helped the Katy Cruisers club team to its second consecutive ASA\nGold National Championship in 2001, playing with UT freshmen pitcher Cat Os\nterman and third baseman/shortstop Tiffany Anders. With her addition, the\nLonghorns will have five players on the roster that have played for the Katy\nCruisers.\n\"Tina is definitely a long-ball threat,\" Clark said. \"She has tremendously\nquick hands and extremely good foot speed. Tina also is the type of player to\nmake things happen because she plays with a lot of passion and enthusiasm.\"\nSievers  finished her 2001 season with a .427 batting average and 19 RBIs.\nShe was named first team All-League and second team All-County as a junior.\nThe 5-0 infielder also was named first team All-California Interscholastic\nFederation (CIF) as a sophomore. She is a member of the California Cruisers\nclub team, which placed second at the 2001 ASA Gold National Championships to\nthe Katy Cruisers.\n\"Chez can cover a lot of ground,\" Clark said. \"She is an extra-base type of\nhitter who also has the ability to play the short game. Chez also has\ntremendously quick hands and I think fans will be excited to watch her play.\"\n\nLonghorn Women Start Fast\n\nSophomore center-forward Stacy Stephens led the Longhorn women's basketball\nteam to the championship of the Paradise Jam Tournament in St. Thomas last\nweekend.\nStephens was named the tourney MVP after leading Texas past Southern\nCalifornia, 66-64, in the championship game. She had 16 points and six of\nthem came in the final two minutes.\nFreshman Heather Schreiber was named to the All-Tournament Team after scoring\n13 points, and another freshman forward, Kala Bowers, had 10 points.\nStephens and senior point guard Kenya Larkin had led Texas to a 75-70 upset\nwin over No. 23 Wisconsin in the semifinals game Saturday.\nStephens had 17 points and 13 rebounds against the Badgers and Larkin added\n14 points and six assists. She also made four free throws in the final two\nminutes.\nThe Longhorns are off to a 3-0 start and host No. 19 LSU Thursday night.\n\nTexas Men 4th in Tourney\n\nThe Longhorn men lost to No. 20 Indiana, 77-71, Saturday in the third-place\ngame in the Great Alaska Shootout Tournament in Anchorage.\nFreshman point guard T. J. Ford led Texas with 16 points and eight assists.\nSenior forward Chris Owens, held scoreless in the first half, got 14 after i\nntermission.\nTexas lost to Gonzaga, 67-64, in the semifinals. Sophomore Royal Ivey had 15\npoints for the Longhorns.\n\nThe Perfect Christmas Present\nFor Horns Who Have Everything Else - A Gift Subscription to True Orange\nand/or the E-Mail/Fax\nA subscription to True Orange is the great gift you can give again and again.\nSure beats Christmas shopping, birthday shopping or anniversary shopping.\nThe only thing better is  a gift of  True Orange and the True Orange Fax  -\nand you can give both for just $130 a year ($99 if they take both by e-mail).\n\no  I am enclosing $45 for a gift subscription ($35 e-mail)\no  I am enclosing $130 for a gift subscription to the newsletter and the fax\n($99 e-mail)\n\nName of Recipient\n\nAddress (& fax no., if applicable)\n\nCity, State, Zip\n\nYour Name\n\nAny Message You Want on Card",

It's more than that. We're not playing well on offense in general.\" \n\n   \nRedskins quarterback Brad Johnson will remain the team's starter against the \nunbeaten Giants.(AP)   \n\nIn the wake of the Redskins' 27-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday \nnight, there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for \nthe key matchup against the undefeated Giants. The Washington offense, one of \nthe league's most diverse in 1999 when it ranked No. 2 overall and second in \nscoring, has been sporadic at best in three games. \n\nA seventh-year veteran who is in the final season of his contract, Johnson \nhas five interceptions the last two games, including four in the fourth \nquarters of those losses. He has not been sharp in either his play-calling or \nhis execution, and even some teammates suggested privately Monday night that \nit might be time for a change. \n\nOne glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the Washington offense to \nthrow the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries. The Redskins have \nonly three completions this year of more than 20 yards, and the longest is 26 \nyards. In Monday's defeat, the team's longest play was a 17-yard dumpoff to \ntailback Stephen Davis. \n\nThe Redskins, who averaged 12.7 yards per completion in 1999 with both \nstarting wide receivers averaging 18-plus yards, are averaging an anemic 9.2 \nyards per catch this season. \n\nBut Turner, who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at \nthis point and retains confidence in Johnson, acknowledged the team needs new \nfocus more than a new starter. \n\n\"There hasn't been any thought to switching (quarterbacks),\" he said. \"Right \nnow, we need to get better at every position, quarterback and everywhere \nelse.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\"Bass, Jason\" <Jason.Bass2@COMPAQ.com> on 09/20/2000 08:29:53 AM\nTo: \"'Eric Bass'\" <Eric.Bass@enron.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: RE: TV\n\n\nJeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 09/19/00\nSepculation is increasing that George may get a chance to start after Brad\nJohnson struggled against Dallas.

Here's a \nsynopsis:\n\nOverall comments\n\n1) Continued improved branding of the Haas EvMBA through the efforts of the \nCareer Center personnel as well as the Haas administration\n\n2) John has implemented a database, tracking the recruitment and career \nsearch outcomes of evening MBA students. Of course, the database is only as \nuseful as the information you provide him on your job search results. So do \ncommunicate to him relevant stats if you have recently switched jobs during \nthe program.\n\n3) A few student-run organizations organize and distribute to companies their \nown resume books. Hence, if you're interested in including your resume in one \nor more of these books, do contact the appropriate person in these \norganizations for additional info.  Here's a url to assist:\n\nhttp://www.haas.berkeley.edu/~mbaa/officialclubs.html\n\n4) Enhanced search capabilities (e.g., by geography and industry) for \nonline-listed alumni jobs as well as including a Haas alumnus (vs. HR) contact\n\nFinally, I would like for us to prioritize for John and the CSOs those good \nideas we discussed. Therefore, from the list below, please respond with 2-4 \nto which you would like more efforts directed, by next Friday, 2/23. Keep in \nmind that this list is not exclusive, so feel free to include your own.\n\n- Job performance workshops\n- Internships\n- On-campus and company site networking events (with alumni if appropriate)\n- Career planning/transition workshops (e.g., job interviewing, resume \npreparation)\n- EvMBA-specific on-campus recruitment (recognize there are limitations to \nsuch an event)\n- EvMBAA-sponsored resume book\n- Student-to-student job fairs\n- Survey list of companies (with contacts) interested in recruiting EvMBAers\n\nAs soon as I tabulate the results, I will present the findings to John and \ndistribute them to you.\n\nThanks in advance for your feedback,\n\nAlbert\ndemery@haas.berkeley.edu",

        "body": "Some thoughts for folks to think about in advance of Friday:\n\n1.  Decision is great on defining LRMC-adopt ARM/ORA vs. UDCs\n2.  Decision identifies specific adjustments to ORA from Utilities, but \ndoesn't identify specific adjustments to ORA from ARM (which Dan has done) \nand which we can point to in comments. The table that compares all proposals \nis excellent!  (It's in Dan's memo) That is a great cross-reference.\n3.  Need to determine whether we support an average for the state, or \nutility-specific.  Which will be more defensible?  I think utility specific.\n4.  I have some challenges to the adjustments that Neeper ultimately adopted.\n5.  The decision requires that the utility procurement function interact with \nthe other utility functions on a comparable basis as ESPs, including access \nto information.  (Good decision language.  Don't know how to enforce.)\n\nHere is a table summarizing the thought process of the revised alternate \ndecision.  ORA-ADJ UDC, is the adjustments to ORA's proposal incorporating \ncriticisms of the UDCs.  The next line (ORA-ADJ ACCPT) are those UDC \ncriticisms accepted by Neeper.  The last is the machinations to average and \nincorporate a bump for ARM's participation.  \n\nCents per MWh\n\n\tPG&E\tSCE\tSDG&E\nUDC\t0\t.02\t3\nORA\t48\t40\t15\nARM\t59\t67\t65\nORA-ADJ UDC\t18\t.8\t6\nORA-ADJ ACCPT\t48\t28\t13\nDECISION-AVG+\t32\t32\t32\n\nI think the items that Dan has identified will provide more than a 2 cent/MWh \nadjustment, so worth quantifying for the record.  These include adjustment \nfor common costs and overheads (FF#27), which ORA said we did a better job \nthan they had.  Also, ARM's itemization of procurement related costs, which \nORA seemed to agree with, is more extensive. \n\n\nChallenges to Adjustments Adopted by Neeper (ORA-ADJ ACCPT)\n\nSDG&E-(pg. 37)\n1.  Would have disallowed $1.2 million.  Neeper disallowed $.2 million (pg. \n38) because those costs are being recovered in 376.  \n\nI will research SDG&E's 376 Settlement Decision, which I believe allows for \nconsideration of those costs in future unbundling proceedings.  (Not sure \nabout SDG&E, sure about SCE)\n\nPG&E-(pg. 38)\nCriticizes ORA for not doing a PG&E-specific study.  PG&E's criticism ORA for \nincluding customer service costs related to its distribution function.  \nNeeper (pg. 40) Says ORA's proxy analysis to SCE is ok.  Discounts PG&E's \ncriticism on customer service costs citing to the RAP decision that those \ncosts should be included in the PX credit.\n\nThis seems to be the best place to advocate use of our numbers over ORA's.  \nWe did a PG&E specific study, which I think would be a valid criticism to \nORA's numbers.  \n\nSCE-(pg.39)\nWould reduce ORA's Energy Service and Marketing costs from $12.3 to $4 \nmillion, because it includes costs related to supply from generation \nsources.  Would reduce Customer Service and Information from $21.1 milion to \n$7.7 million saying that is the amount of CS&I the Commission had allocated \nto generation.  Neeper (pg. 40) accepts reduction of ES&M to $4 million.  \nNeeper does not discuss CS&I.\n\nNeed MRW input on whether SCE's criticisms are valid.  Seems like we have \nmany areas to supplement ORA's numbers, based on the table in Dan's note.",

In mid-March, they'll turn their attention to home=20\r\ncustomers.=20\r\n\r\nHowever, Public Utility Commission chairman Pat Wood III said both=20\r\nresidential and commercial customers may sign up beginning Thursday.=20\r\n\r\nCommercial users must go through a lottery to be chosen, and the 5 percent=\r\n=20\r\nwill be based on total commercial electricity used.=20\r\n\r\nResidential customers will be added on a first-come, first-picked basis, wi=\r\nth=20\r\nthe cutoff after 5 percent of all residential customers have volunteered fo=\r\nr=20\r\nthe program.=20\r\n\r\nA key to the Texas program is the \"price to beat,\" the basic rate that the=\r\n=20\r\nutilities can charge. That price will be a 6 percent reduction from the=20\r\nelectric rates charged by the utilities before the pilot program begins.=20\r\n\r\nThe investor-owned utilities also include Central Power & Light, Southweste=\r\nrn=20\r\nElectric Power Co., Entergy, SESCO and Southwestern Public Service Co.=20\r\n\r\nOther companies can charge whatever they please, but as Mr. Hadley noted,=\r\n=20\r\nthey probably won't get too far charging more than the \"price-to-beat\" rate=\r\ns=20\r\nof the utilities.=20\r\n\r\nWhen the Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 7 in 1999 to start retail=20\r\ncompetition in electricity, the price-to-beat rate was set up to give=20\r\ncompetitors a chance to compete against the entrenched utilities.=20\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley said the price to beat provides other electric retailers=20\r\n\"something to work against.\" In addition, the 6 percent reduction from the=\r\n=20\r\nutilities' current rates would be \"enough of a cut to provide a customer a=\r\n=20\r\nbenefit, but not so low as to prevent competition,\" he said.=20\r\n\r\nOf course, the utilities don't have their hands tied in areas outside their=\r\n=20\r\ncurrent monopoly territory, and most plan to compete aggressively for=20\r\ncustomers.=20\r\n\r\nFor example, TNP Enterprises Inc., parent of Texas-New Mexico Power, has=20\r\ncreated a subsidiary, First Choice Power Inc., to lead its fight in the=20\r\nelectric wars.=20\r\n\r\nJim Niewald, First Choice director of marketing, said the company will use=\r\n=20\r\nthe pilot period as a learning time, to test ways to compete and to market=\r\n=20\r\nits products.=20\r\n\r\n\"We're going to take a sort of moderate approach. We're not going to be rea=\r\nl=20\r\naggressive. On the other hand, we're not going to be sitting back totally,\"=\r\n=20\r\nMr. Niewald said.=20\r\n\r\nTXU spokesman Chris Schein said the Dallas-based company sees the pilot=20\r\nperiod as a time to work out kinks and discover if there are any inherent=\r\n=20\r\nproblems in the way that electricity competition in Texas works.=20\r\n\r\n\"It's important to remember that the pilot program is less of a marketing=\r\n=20\r\nevent than it is an opportunity for TXU and the rest of the state to test=\r\n=20\r\nsystems.

There should be no combustible material\nthere, and sooner or later a fire will result.  You are fortunate the result\nwas not worse.  The important metal underlayment supplied with the fireplace\nwas not installed.  The fireplace must be moved about 5\" up to the face of\nthe wall.  All the tile must be removed and replaced with non combustible\nunderlayment.  The chimney seems ok but you must replace the cap and the\nchimney is no longer available, necessitating fireplace replacement if it\never becomes necessary due to corrosion.  The insulation is probably wet,\nwhich happens over the years and it settles, leaving hot spots in the\nchimney.  At least yours is out in the air, but it should be checked, and\nwill be if I do this job.\nYou will provide the tile, and bear in mind that some will have to be cut,\nso avoid small tiles.  You will also provide sanded grout and grout\nadditive, and a mastic (25#) such as epoxy \"Elastobon\".  Your tile supplier\nwill know what we're talking about.  I will get all other materials locally.\nYou are looking at, I estimate, $2,400.00 - $3,200.00 plus materials.  I\nprefer to work jobs like this at Time and Materials, based on my labor rate\nof $50.00 per man hour.  If I have to bid this job, it will be suitably\ninflated to deal with unforeseen variables.  I have been here for 26 years\nwithout any construction related problems, and have lots of references.\nThe materials will consist of cedar shingles, plywood, roofing shingles\n(asphalt), glue, Wonder Board tile underlayment, stainless steel cap, 2X4's,\nscrews, plumbing fittings for the gas line, sheet metal, and incidentals.\nMy estimate is done as accurately as possible, but unforeseen problems could\nchange the time I've estimated for the job.  The materials will be about\n$700.00, and this is the deposit I will require.  Let me know what the ETA\nof your tile will be.  If you prefer, I can do the job without the tile,\nleaving the Wonder Board tile underlayment exposed, which is totally safe,\nand you can decide upon tile later, after looking at the site after the\nfireplace is moved.  I will need a half square min. to do the roof of the\nfireplace pop out.\nRegards,\nWill Guyan",

So far, there is no evidence they are doing anything \nillegal.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gray Davis has called them pirates and plunderers. The San \nFrancisco city attorney has filed a $1 billion lawsuit against them, saying \nthey are playing with \"marked cards\" and looking to make a \"quick buck\" at \nthe expense of consumers. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is \ninvestigating, as are state regulators in Washington, Oregon and California. \n\n\"Based on hints of manipulated energy supplies and allegations of price \nmanipulation, I think we owe it to Washington utilities and consumers to make \nsure the soaring prices are not the result of illegal practices,\" Washington \nAttorney General Christine Gregoire said in announcing her office's antitrust \ndivision would investigate. \n\nThe power marketers, though, say they've done nothing wrong. The real \nproblem, they say, is there simply isn't enough power being generated to meet \ndemand. \n\nThe players include Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc., and Reliant Energy, all of \nHouston; Duke Energy of Charlotte, N.C.; Southern Energy of Atlanta; AES Inc. \nof Arlington, Va., and Calpine Corp. of San Jose, Calif. \n\nEnron's profits were up 34 percent in last year's fourth quarter. Duke's \nfourth-quarter revenues doubled; Dynegy's earnings more than doubled in the \nfourth quarter. \n\n\"When we hear about these stunning profit increases, I think we need to \ninvestigate,\" Gregoire said. \n\nCorporate raider Charles Hurwitz also could profit handsomely. His Maxxam \nInc. owns Kaiser Aluminum Corp., which has shut down its Washington mills \nand, under a special contract provision, is reselling power on the open \nmarket for much more than it paid the Bonneville Power Administration, the \nfederal agency that sells hydropower generated at dams along the Columbia and \nSnake rivers. Hurwitz could make half a billion dollars before the contracts \nexpire this fall. \n\nAnd the holding companies of two huge California utilities on the edge of \nbankruptcy have made billions of dollars off the West Coast electricity \nmarket through a financial juggling act. Audits by outside auditors hired by \nstate regulators showed Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric \nturned over billions to their holding companies, money that could have been \nused to ease the cash crunch they now face. \n\nThe utilities say they were engaged in accepted business practices when they \ntransferred the money, which the parent companies used for such things as \nstockholder dividends and stock buybacks. \n\n\"Is it capitalism or profiteering?\" said Ed Mosey, a BPA spokesman. \"The very \ncomplexity of these markets allows these companies to hide in the grass.\" \n\nA few years ago, the energy industry was tightly regulated and utilities and \ngenerators were allowed to recover their costs and make a decent return on \ntheir investment. \n\nBut beginning with the deregulation of wholesale electricity markets in 1992, \nenergy marketers, generators, independent power producers and others became \nmajor players. Regulated utilities opened computer-driven trading rooms as \nthey scrambled to find the cheapest electricity available. \n\nNow electricity is sold on spot and longer-term markets, traded for \nelectricity available in other parts of the country or even swapped for \nnatural gas. \n\n\"Power can pass through three or four hands before you even buy it,\" Tacoma \nPower Superintendent Steve Klein said. \n\nThe latest jolts in the Northwest market began last summer when California \nexperienced severe shortages and prices soared. \n\nBecause the entire West Coast is connected by one power grid, the rate shocks \nwere felt in the Northwest and grew even more as California's problems \ndeepened and a winter drought prompted fears of a near-record low runoff in \nthe Columbia and Snake rivers. \n\nSome called it a \"perfect storm\" scenario, and BPA saw the price it paid for \npower in January grow sixfold over the previous year. \n\n\"We will buy from anyone who will sell to us at a reasonable prices, but the \nproblem is finding a reasonable price,\" said BPA Administrator Steve Wright. \n\"The marketers are recovering a substantial amount of money.\" \n\nThe same companies making money in California are making money in the \nNorthwest. \"These are for-profit companies,\" said Mark Crisson, who heads \nTacoma Power. \"These folks don't answer to a (state regulatory) commission \nand they don't answer to ratepayers. They answer to their stockholders and \nI've seen no effort by them to minimize prices.\" \n\nCritics say the energy marketers have manipulated the market by shutting down \ngenerating facilities in California in an effort to restrict the supply and \ndrive prices up. \n\nAccording to some utility executives, generating plants are usually off-line \n5 percent of the time because of unforeseen problems and that an off-line \naverage of 10 percent to 15 percent would be considered high. During some \nmonths, certain California generating plants have been off-line 30 percent to \n50 percent of the time. \n\n\"We are seeing abnormal rates,\" Crisson said. \n\nAsked whether he thought the companies were manipulating, or gaming, the \nmarket, Crisson said, \"I would stop short of accusing them of that, but there \nis something funny going on.\" \n\nThe California generators and marketers say the outages have been the result \nof running aging plants hard in an effort to supply power in a tight market. \n\n\"We think these allegations are a little unfair,\" said Randy Wheeless, a \nspokesman for Duke Energy, which operates four power plants in California. \nDespite several investigations, Wheeless said, his and other companies have \nalways been cleared. \n\n\"We're trying to feed the market, not manipulate it,\" he said. \"There isn't \nany one single person or company to blame. The remedy is to get more \ngeneration on line.\" \n\nEnron doesn't own any power plants in California but sells and trades energy \nthroughout the West. Spokesman Mark Palmer agreed that the key to solving the \ncurrent crisis is adding more generation and truly deregulating the \nCalifornia market so there is real competition. \"Everyone is scrambling for \npower,\" he said. \n- - - \n* Staff writer Les Blumenthal covers Northwest issues in Congress.

(NYSE:AZX - \nnews) said Tuesday it would formally agree this week to improve its Argentine \nwater services after it was accused of providing poor service to Buenos Aires \nprovince. \n\nAzurix, an affiliate of energy supplier Enron Corp. (NYSE:ENE - news) which \nsaid in January it would take a fourth-quarter charge of $470 million on its \nArgentine operations, had previously fended off the criticism by blaming \nBuenos Aires province's poor infrastructure. \n\n``This week an agreement will be signed,'' an Azurix spokesman told Reuters. \n``The cost of the projects during 2001 will be less than $30 million.'' \n\nThe dispute climaxed in January, when Buenos Aires province said it would \nreview Azurix's 30-year, $439 million water and wastewater service contract. \nIt said there were widespread customer complaints, such as low water pressure \nand algae contamination in the city's reservoir. \n\nAzurix argued that the province did not provide the necessary infrastructure \nor allow the company to charge fair market rates for services. \n\nShares of Azurix added 1 cent at $8.32 Tuesday on the New York Stock \nExchange. \n\n\n\nUSA: US Stockpile awards 3,400 tonnes lead to 3 firms.\n\n02/13/2001\nReuters English News Service \n(C) Reuters Limited 2001. \n\nNEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense National Stockpile Center said \nTuesday it awarded approximately 3,400 metric tonnes of lead to three firms \nin its latest solicitation of offers. \n\nNey Smelting & Refining Co. Inc., Lead Products Co. Inc. and Enron Metals & \nCommodity Corp. received the material for an estimated market value of $1.6 \nmillion.\n\n\n\nMarathon Oil in race for Enron stake in oil fields \nThe Financial Express, 02/13/2001 \n\nAnupama Airy & Kavita Bhaskaran \n\nNew Delhi, Feb 13: The US-based energy major, Marathon Oil and Gas Company \nhas emerged as one of the strong contenders for picking up Enron's 30 per \ncent stake in the Mukta, Panna and Tapti oil and gas fields. \n\nTop industry sources disclosed that Marathon has also been shortlisted in the \nfirst round of bidding along with Reliance and ONGC for buying Enron's stake \nin these fields. \n\nWhereas, both Reliance and ONGC are part of the consortia already developing \nthese fields, Marathon is the only company which has been shortlisted outside \nthe consortia. \n\n\"Currently, Marathon is doing the due diligence of Enron's assets following \nwhich it will submit the financial bids along with other shortlisted \nparties,\" the sources said. \n\nSources informed that Marathon possesses some of the best oil and gas \nexploration technologies in the world, and, at one point of time, even ONGC \nwas in talks with Marathon for acquiring its technology. \n\nAsked if there was any possibility of ONGC and Marathon joining hands for \nsubmission of financial bids, industry sources said both the companies have \ndecided to bid independently. \n\nMoreover, for all these discovered fields, ONGC does not require any \nfinancial or technical support from others. Reliance, however, is not \nqualified to be the operator of oil and gas fields as it does not have \nsufficient experience in the area. \n\nOn the other hand, Marathon possess strong technical skills in this area and, \nif selected, can easily qualify as an operator.ONGC is the biggest partner in \nthe consortium in terms of its equity stake. \n\nIt has 40 per cent with the remaining 60 per cent, shared equally between \nReliance Industries and Enron Oil and Gas India. \n\nHowever, Enron is the operator of this $900 million joint venture between \nReliance and ONGC. Both ONGC and Reliance have the pre-emption rights by \nvirtue of being partners in the joint ventures operating these companies. \n\nBut this does not mean that they will get it any cheaper. They will have to \nmatch the highest bidder, sources said. \n\nIt may be recalled here that Enron has recently decided to sell its entire \noil and gas assets in India. The buyer for these assets is to be selected \nthrough a two-stage bidding process. \n\nCredit Suisse First Boston has been appointed as the investment banker to \nderive current value of its stake in the joint venture. These oil and gas \nfields in Gujarat and Mumbai offshore are reportedly producing around 300 \nmillion cubic metre of gas and 29,000 barrels of oil per day. \n\nCopyright , 2001 Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Ltd. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n",

        "body": "Enron, as part of our alliance, ARM, has entered into a settlement w/ SDG&E, \nORA, DGS and the Golden State Cooperative on Direct Access Service Fees.  \nThese are fees that the utility could assess on either DA customers or ESPs \nproviding service to DA customers.  This settlement has been filed with the \nCPUC.  IT HAS NOT BEEN ADOPTED YET.  I will notify all if, and when, that \nhappens.\n\nSDG&E went particularly \"hog-wild\" on the number of fees proposed as well as \nthe level of the fees.  By our settlement, I believe, conservatively, we have \neliminated about $100 of additional charges per customer per year.\n\nWe have agreed that no fees will be assessed for services that the utility \nprovides as part of its market facilitation function through 2002.  This is \nin keeping with the fact that the utility is currently recovering those costs \nthrough distribution rates as part of a settlement in a separate proceeding \n(376).  Those functions include MSP and MDMA certification, DASR processing, \nEDI acceptance testing, ESP and EDI agreement processing, credit \nestablishments and on-going credit checks, processing meter change \ninformation, providing customer data.\n\nPOTENTIAL NEW CHARGES:\n\nSpecial Services:\n\nWhere we ASK the utility to perform functions for us (researching data, \nproviding administrative support, non-standard processing of information (ie. \nmanual vs. EDI)) there will be a charge.  They must specify to us that the \nservice that we are requesting will result in a fee being assessed and what \nthe charge will be.  We must agree to the terms before the service is \nprovided.  This means we must be very clear in our communications with the \nutility on special requests.  \n\nException Fees:\n\nThis is where we fail to meet our obligation to the utility and they assess, \nessentially, a penalty.   Examples include missed appointment meets, late \npayments, failure to provide usage data by 11th business day causing utility \nto estimate data, causing a rebill for failure to provide valid usage data.  \n(More detailed description is contained within the attached documents.) \nWe have negotiated that there be a .5% deadband before any fee is assessed \nfor estimating data.  We have negotiated that, to the extent the utility is \nresponsible for causing US to rebill, we can accumulate banking credits to \nuse against any charges that the utility would assess us.  It provides some \nreciprocity.\n\nWe do have a dispute resolution process.  However, if we need an internal \nbriefing on the settlement so folks are comfortable about how it will work, I \nwould be happy to assist with that. \n\nPlease contact me with any questions.\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Mona L Petrochko/SFO/EES on 09/20/2000 \n07:03 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"Delaney, Laurie\" <LDelaney@sempra.com> on 09/14/2000 03:02:49 PM\nTo: \"'sfc@cpuc.ca.gov'\" <sfc@cpuc.ca.gov>, \"'jbennett@gmssr.com'\" \n<jbennett@gmssr.com>, \"'abb@eslawfirm.com'\" <abb@eslawfirm.com>, \n\"'rmccann@cal.net'\" <rmccann@cal.net>, \"'athomas@newenergy.com'\" \n<athomas@newenergy.com>, \"'msw@cpuc.ca.gov'\" <msw@cpuc.ca.gov>, \n\"'mpetroch@enron.com'\" <mpetroch@enron.com>\ncc: \"Thompson, Vicki L.\" <VThompson@sempra.com>, \"Szymanski, Paul\" \n<PSzymanski@sempra.com> \nSubject: A99-06-041 Joint Motion for Adoption of Settlement and Joint Peti \ntion to set Aside Submission & Reopen the Record for Purposes of Admittin g a \nLate Filed Exhibit\n\n\n\n\n - ld2d-#75429-1.DOC\n - ld2d-#75426-1.DOC\n - ld2d-#75427-1.DOC\n - ld2d-#75428-1.DOC\n",

The attorney representing the\r\nFCC bore the brunt of the judges' frustrations and, at times, caustic\r\ncomments on that issue.\r\n\r\nBut on the legal issues, the lawyer representing the National Exchange\r\nCarrier Association, Inc., in its challenge to an FCC decision seemed to\r\ntake the harder hits.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington must\r\ndecide whether the FCC acted \"arbitrarily and capriciously\" in prescribing\r\na 6.5% increase in \"average schedule\" universal service support.\r\n\r\n\"Average schedule\" companies use formulas derived by NECA and\r\napproved by the FCC to approximate their per-loop costs of providing\r\nservice.  This is in contrast to so-called \"cost companies,\" which perform\r\nstudies to calculate their actual per-loop costs.\r\n\r\nThe case marks the first time that NECA, which the FCC has charged\r\nwith updating the formula used by \"average schedule\" companies to\r\ncalculate universal service support, has asked the court to review an FCC\r\norder, NECA attorney Richard A. Askoff pointed out during oral\r\narguments this morning.\r\n\r\nThe judges spent as much time seeking information on how the \"average\r\nschedule\" mechanism works as they did questioning attorneys about their\r\nlegal arguments.  Judge David S. Tatel asked for clarification of how the\r\n\"average schedule\" formula was applied to individual companies.\r\n\r\nAfter FCC attorney Laurel Bergold spent nearly all her allotted time in an\r\nunsuccessful attempt to clarify that aspect of the case, Chief Judge Harry\r\nT. Edwards commented, \"We get hard things from the FCC, but this\r\n[case] is bizarre.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Askoff apparently cleared up the matter for the judges during his\r\nrebuttal arguments.  He explained that certain data (such as the number\r\nof loops per exchange) is plugged into the \"average schedule\" formula to\r\ndetermine a given carrier's amount of support.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Askoff faced some tough questions from Judge Douglas H.\r\nGinsburg regarding NECA's argument that it hadn't received proper\r\nnotice of the FCC's intention to prescribe the 6.5% adjustment.  Judge\r\nGinsburg wondered what NECA would have said to the FCC, if it had\r\nreceived notice, that it didn't say in advocating a 33% increase in\r\nuniversal service support for \"average schedule\" carriers.\r\n\r\nMr. Askoff said NECA would have discussed the \"fallacy\" of the FCC's\r\nbelief that universal service support should be tied to growth in the\r\nnumber of local loops.  Judge Edwards replied that NECA already had\r\nmade that argument before the FCC.\r\n\r\nThe case (\"National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc., v. FCC,\" no. 00-\r\n1055) stems from an FCC decision to reject NECA's proposed \"average\r\nschedule\" universal service formula for 1998-1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n*******************************************************\r\nCLECs WANT RECORD ON PACIFIC BELL\r\nInterLATA SERVICE BID `REFRESHED'\r\n\r\nThe California Office of Ratepayer Advocates, several trade associations\r\nrepresenting competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), and nine\r\nindividual CLECs have asked the state Public Utilities Commission to\r\n\"refresh\" its record on Pacific Bell's compliance with federally mandated\r\nmarket-opening standards before deciding whether the telco has met those\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\nIn a joint petition filed Friday, Feb. 2, they argued that the record in th=\r\ne\r\nproceeding was \"too stale\" for the commission to reach credible\r\nconclusions about Pacific Bell's compliance with the market-opening\r\nmandates by May 24--the date the commission is scheduled to issue a final\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nCompliance with a 14-point competitive \"checklist\" of market-opening\r\nmoves outlined in section 271 of the federal Telecommunications Act of\r\n1996 is a prerequisite to Bell companies' receiving FCC authorization to\r\nprovide in-region interLATA (local access and transport area) service.=20\r\nThe FCC is required to consult with relevant state commissions and the\r\nJustice Department before ruling on a Bell company's section 271\r\napplication.  Bell companies typically try to convince the state regulators\r\nof their compliance before submitting an application to the FCC.\r\n\r\nThe joint petitioners told the California commission that the record in the\r\nproceeding could be supplemented \"in a relatively prompt and efficient\r\nmanner.\"\r\n\r\nIf \"Pacific Bell intends to include updated or other additional information\r\nin its application to be filed with the FCC, then it should make\r\nthatinformation available to the [California commission] and the parties to\r\nthis proceeding now,\" the petitioners said.  Such action would be\r\n\"consistent with the FCC's goal that the state commission be the principal\r\nforum for resolving factual disputes in the first instance, rather than\r\nrequire the [California commission] and the parties to address Pacific\r\nBell's showing for the first time after being thrust into an expedited\r\nreview process before the federal agency in Washington, D.C.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, the joint petitioners\r\nwere the California Association of Competitive Telecommunications\r\nCompanies, the Association of Communications Enterprises, the\r\nCompetitive Telecommunications Association, AT&T Communications of\r\nCalifornia, Inc., WorldCom, Inc., Advanced Telcom, Inc., XO\r\nCalifornia, Inc., Spring Communications Co. LP, New Edge Network,\r\nInc., ICG Telecom Group, Inc., Rhythms Links, Inc., and Time Warner\r\nTelecom of California, Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\n*******************************************************\r\nCONSUMER GROUPS CALL FOR `PRO-COMPETITIVE' FCC\r\nACTION\r\n\r\nThe Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union today issued\r\na report stating that policy-makers have failed in their attempt to expand\r\nconsumer choice in local and broadband services.  In \"Lessons from the\r\n1996 Telecommunications Act,\" the groups called for increased regulation\r\nof large companies that \"continue to monopolize the cable TV and local\r\ntelephone industries.\"\r\n\r\nThe report said the Act's failure stems from the fact that the major\r\nproviders of cable TV and local phone service have chosen to merge\r\nrather than compete.  \"Most of the local phone service market still\r\nbelongs to the regional Bell monopolies, which, thanks to a series of\r\nmergers, have shrunk from seven companies in 1996 into just four today,\"\r\nthe groups said.\r\n\r\nThe report asked lawmakers to promote \"meaningful competition\" among\r\nlocal service providers by pressing for adoption of certain market-opening\r\nprinciples nationwide.  It specifically cites local market-opening moves in\r\nNew York and Texas.\r\n\r\nIn the broadband services market, a handful of dominant companies have\r\nrefused to enter each other's markets, agreeing instead to merge and swap\r\nassets, the report says.  \"Cable monopolies have saddled consumers with\r\nhuge rate increases and sought to impose their closed business model on\r\nthe broadband Internet by making it nearly impossible for outside\r\ncompanies to offer Internet services over the monopolies' cable lines,\" the\r\ngroups stated.\r\n\r\nThey asked lawmakers to put an end to \"abusive\" cable TV pricing\r\npractices, require telcos to provide nondiscriminatory access to their\r\nhigh-speed networks, enforce media ownership limits that promote\r\ndiversity, and block further consolidation that undermines potential\r\ncompetition. =20\r\n\r\n\r\n*******************************************************\r\nMOBILE PHONE INDUSTRY FACES LATEST HEALTH-RELATED\r\nLAWSUIT\r\n\r\nThe wireless phone industry is facing another lawsuit, this one filed on\r\nbehalf of a 38-year-old Georgia man who says his cellphone caused his\r\nbrain tumor.  It's the latest in a growing number of such lawsuits alleging\r\nthat the industry manufactured and marketed the devices despite knowing\r\ntheir potential adverse health effects.\r\n\r\nThe lawsuit, \"Brian Lane Barrett and Diana Barrett v. Nokia Corp. et al.\"\r\n(case no.2001CV33385), was filed in Fulton County Superior Court in\r\nAtlanta Jan. 29.  In addition to Nokia, the lawsuit names BellSouth\r\nMobility, Inc., and the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association\r\n(now the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association) as\r\ndefendants.  It seeks compensatory and punitive damages but doesn't list\r\nan amount.\r\n\r\nThe 10-count lawsuit claims that the defendants \"knew or should have\r\nknown\" the phones \"to be defective, unreasonably dangerous, and\r\nhazardous.\"\r\n\r\nSpokespersons for the defendants declined to comment on the lawsuit.=20\r\n\r\n\r\n*******************************************************\r\nILECs:  `DISTORTIONS' FROM `RECIP COMP' COULD GET\r\nWORSE\r\n\r\nIncumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) say their reciprocal\r\ncompensation payments to competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs)\r\nare continuing to increase, making it even more imperative that the FCC\r\nchange its rules regarding the payments  between carriers for terminating\r\nlocal traffic.  The ILECs told the FCC that declining network costs and\r\nincreasing traffic flows are producing \"ever greater economic\r\ninefficiencies and distortions.\"\r\n\r\nRobert T. Blau, vice president-executive and federal regulatory affairs at\r\nBellSouth Corp., addressed the issue in a Feb. 1 letter to Common Carrier\r\nBureau Chief Dorothy Attwood.

Most\r\nobservers project that dial-up access minutes will continue to grow rapidly\r\nfor at least the next three years, Mr. Blau said.  In addition, changes in\r\ntechnology and capital cost reductions are \"offsetting reciprocal\r\ncompensation declines,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Blau estimated that the cost to CLECs of carrying dial-up calls to\r\nInternet service providers (ISPs) \"works out to about $0.0001 per minute,\r\nor about 2% to 5% of current reciprocal compensation rates.\"  He said\r\neliminating reciprocal compensation in favor of a \"bill-and-keep\" system\r\nwould not force CLECs to raise per-line fees for ISP customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n*******************************************************\r\nNEWS IN BRIEF\r\n\r\nFormer National Telecommunications and Information Administrator\r\nGregory L.

Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of \nExisting Powerplants\n2.  Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities\n3.  Centralize Authority and/or Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting \nand Construction\n\nThe tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting \npowerplants; and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full \ncapacity.  (ie; the carrot and the stick)\n\nThey also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators \nto sell their power under contract to the State Dept. of Water.\n\nSome of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will \nbe:\n\n- How much capacity is truly \"idling\" and will be able to be brought back on \nline or increase its output?\n- Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create \nflexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to \npositively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction \nand operation?\n- How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and \nhow soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given \nthe other issues in CA?\n\nWe will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders, but wanted to get \ninformation to you in a timely manner.\n\nD-22-01  Increased Output/Expedited Siting Mandates \n  \nCEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power \ngenerators. \n- limited to less than 50MWs using existing installed capacity b/w \n06/01-10/01/01 \n\nExpedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal \npowerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate.\n\nAccelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed \nthermal powerplants.\n\nAction by the State Water Resources Control Board  to insure wastewater \nissues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating.\n\nRequirements for the State Dept. of Water Resources to purchase power from \npowerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not \nother market for their power.\n\nExpires  12/31/01 unless extended\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThis Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are \ncurrently not operating or not operating at full capacity.  It does not waive \nair quality requirements (they are addressed in a separate order).  \n\nD-23-01  Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements\n\nISO Requirements:\n- Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO\n- Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly\n- Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities\n- Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide \nthose records to Electricity Oversight Board\n- Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below \nperformance benchmarks est. by the ISO\n- Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to \nimpose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities \nhave fallen     below performance benchmarks est. by the ISO\n\nRequires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and \nProtocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISO's ability \nto ensure adequate power during peak demand.\n\nInstructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by \nutilities are operated as required to maintain reliability.\n\nRequires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its \nauthority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est. \nbenchmarks for availability and performance, and issue fines against those \nplants, after a hearing.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nAgain, the tone of this order is that the state won't tolerate outages as an \nexcuse for not generating.  It is also an attempt to better manage planned \noutages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants \nwhere off-line for maintenance at the same time.\n\nD-24-01  Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures\n\nMandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of \noperation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities \nthat provide power under contract to the Dept. of Water Resources are not \nrestricted in their ability to operate.\n- Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable \nemissions in excess of the previous limits\n- If air districts do not comply, the Board (CARB?) shall impose \nmodifications on the permits in lieu of districts\n\nThe Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions \nreductions from all available sources:\n- Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need \nemissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the \nSummer Peak Season in 2001\n- In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to \nthe Dept. of Water Resources, CA will make available where necessary and \navailable the required emissions credits at up to a 50 percent reduction,\n- In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity, \nemissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to \nfacilities where necessary and available.\n- Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made \navailable to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the \nnew or expanded facility is located.\n\nExpires 12/31/2001 unless extended\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThis order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours \nfor air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept. \nof Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit \nbank available for use by other sources.  There are a lot of details that \nremain to be clarified, including how the state is going to locate emissions \nreduction credits where developers were unsuccessful.  However, it is a step \nin the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive \nauthority back to the state level.\n\nD-25-01  Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants\n\nExpedites review and approval of post-certification amendments to increase \noutput from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission.\n\nAuthorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes \nand regulations that normally control post-certifications to the extent that \nthey impact prompt mitigation of this emergency.\n\nRequires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of \nconstruction within one year of certification, and for the construction phase \nof the project.  Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy \nCommission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of \nthe certification.\n\nExpires 12/31/01 unless extended\n\nAnalysis\n\nAgain, no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and \ncompleted in a timely manner.\n\nD-26-01  Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources\n\nRequires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to 7 days for \nrequired environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all \npowerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission (under 50MWs) and \nthat are proposed to be on line by summer 2001.\n\n Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways:\n- Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants \nfor construction and operation by July 31, 2001.\n-Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO \nand can be online by July 2001 may also apply to be permitted by the Energy \nCommission under the emergency siting process.\n-Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within \nfour months, shall apply to any proposed simple-cycle thermal powerplant that \ncan be brought on line by August 31, 2002  and that have an application for \ncertification complete by Dec. 31. 2001.\n-Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants, emission \noffset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for \ncertification\n-The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites \nin the state and prepare a report by 02/21/01  identifying those areas of the \nstate that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to \naugment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of 2003.\n\nIOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within 7 days of receipt \nof completed application.\n\nExpires 12/31/01 unless extended.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThis is an attempt to accelerate the permitting of smaller sources and \npeaking units.",

We \nspoke to them about being a transmission operator during the E-Trans \nconsortium discussion last fall.  Paul told me that they have been actively \npursuing an offer for the transmission systems of PG&E and SCE as an \nalternative to the State of California taking title to the transmission \nsystem as part of the legislative solution.  Some of our fellow marketers are \nsufficiently concerned about California ownership that they have offered to \nprovide funding to the effort, not as investors which would taint the \nacquisition, but more of grant to assist the effort.  Paul did not tell me \nwho the parties are, but it is probably the \"usual suspects\" who own \ngeneration in California (my guess).  \n\nPaul called to see how we would view this effort.  They are interested in the \npossibility of our supporting a private acquisition of the transmission \nassets, not necessarily financial, but the use of our contacts and personnel \nto provide public and private support to such an effort.  \n\nAs I think about the State owning the transmission system and being the \npurchaser of energy, it seems like they are assembling a large vertically \nintegrated public power utility under the control of the Governor -- de facto \nre-regulation only worse.  Once the state own the transmission system, I \ndoubt it would every be privatized.  \n\nWhat are your views?  Would Enron be interested in supporting this effort?\n\nSteve",

Regulatory expects to receive confirmation next week that \nthe 1% annual Singapore telecom license fee will apply only to Singapore \nbandwidth.  Given that Asia trading will be centralized in Singapore, we want \nto make sure that the activities of traders outside of Singapore do not cause \nthe Singapore trading operations to be subject to tax outside of Singapore.  \nIn this regard, Asia traders should keep in mind the following general rules:\n\nTraders that regularly engage in the execution of trades outside of Singapore \nwill create a taxable presence outside of Singapore that will likely result \nin double taxation.\nTraders that regularly engage in the negotiation of trades outside of \nSingapore will create a significant risk that local tax authorities will \nassert that such activities created a taxable presence outside of Singapore \nthat would likely result in double taxation.  EBS Tax would want to monitor \nsuch a situation very closely, so please let us know immediately if these \ncircumstances arise.\nTraders engaging only in the solicitation of business and the provision of \nproduct information (including pricing) outside of Singapore will not create \na taxable presence outside of Singapore.  In this regard, please note that \neven if traders restrict themselves to business solicitation, a large scale \npresence in any given country could attract the attention of the tax \nauthorities who may adopt aggressive positions with regard to the creation of \na taxable presence.  \n\nWhen in doubt as to the application of these general rules to a specific \nsituation, please do not hesitate to call.\n\nThanks.\n\nW.

I updated a price for Freeman for 200MW Peak SP-15 5 Year \n($124/MWh).  I also spoke with their lawyers a couple of times to start \ntrading comments.  I volunteered to send a team to LA today or tomorrow, but \nso far they prefer to discuss by phone.   Their lawyers acknowledge that the \nprimary issue for suppliers is credit.  They are working on an agreement with \nCPUC that would ensure that CDWR would have an adequate revenue stream to \nsupport the contracts.  Their intent is to make the supply contracts have \npriority over the bonds.  Until that happens, we maintain that we require a \ncash prepayment or letter of credit to support any deal.  I expect to hear \nfrom them again later today.  I will keep you posted.\n\nRegards,\n\nChris",

        "body": "Some corrections to the write-up for the first one for EES, some attribtuon \nchanges (I think) and an additional valuation for EES.  Also, includes \nchanges to the write-ups for ENA and what I got from Tim Belden.  I also have \na note discussing Tim Belden's \"philosophy\" in giving me valuations.\n\nEES\n\nRAP '98\nEnron raised the issue of the UDCs imposing an artificial cap on the PX \ncredit for direct customers during the very first proceedings during which \nthe method of CTC collection was raised.  The CPUC shined us on. Later, we \nraised it in the very first Revenue Adjustment Proceeding (RAP '98) RAP '98 \nand ensured that it became part of WPTF's case as well.  The way the \"cap\" \nworked, the UDCs would not pay ESPs the full PX credit when prices were high \n-- they would pay a credit that, when added to the other bill components, did \nnot exceed the frozen rate for the direct access customer, thereby costing \nESPs a lot of  money  potentially.  It was clear in the previous CPUC direct \naccess decisions that UDCs had no right to cap direct access credits. Because \nof our good case and the fact that the UDCs believed the chance of such high \nPX prices was LOW, the UDCs settled on this issue in 1999.\n\n2000 NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides: $30 - 40 million\n% Attributed to Enron's GA Efforts: 90%\n\nGreen Credit Legislation\nEnron and other green suppliers began work in 1998 to extend the credit given \nfor sales of green power. The credit was scheduled to end by 2002. In 1999, \nthe money specified in AB 1890 was being depleted rapidly and Green Mountain \ntook the lead in pressing for legislation. We actively supported Green \nMountain by lobbying legislators and other interest groups, working with \nenvironmental organisations, and spearheading legislative amendments.  \nAlthough this bill became wrapped up in the San Diego crisis and ISO/PX \nissues, the green credit portion of the bill remained intact.  We had also \ndecided jointly to propose a ten-year credit and were very pleased and \nsurprised that it survived into the final bill.  Governor Davis is expected \nto sign the bill. \n\n2000 NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides: $50 million\n% Attributed to Enron's GA Efforts: 25%\n\nRAP '99\nEnron, through ARM, has successfully made its case that retail procurement \nand retail sales costs should be removed from the Distribution Charge that \nall customers pay.  Direct Access customers would receive a credit on their \nbills in addition to the PX credit. Enron was the first party to raise these \nissues as part of RAP '98 and got a Commission decision in that case to \ndetermine the credit in RAP '99.  In RAP '99, Enron chose to use ARM to \nlitigate the case as a cheaper alternative.  Hearings were completed in the \nSpring of 2000.  ARM has negotiated settlement rates with certain parties and \nhas convinced the Assigned Commissioner to draft his own decision to \ncounteract the unfavorable ALJ decision. An additional credit of from $0.25 \nto $0.30/MWh is expected.  The decision will be voted out within the next two \nmonths.\n\n2000 NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides: $1 - 5 million\n% Attributed to Enron's GA Efforts: 75%\n\nSan Diego Marketing\nGovernment Affairs worked closely with EES origination to help the staff \nunderstand the wildly fluctuating regulatory and political arena in San Diego \nand to assist its efforts to take advantage of the unique marketing \nopportunity afforded by volatile wholesale market prices.  EES created a new \nEnron milestone.  Beginning at a point with no personnel working on San Diego \ndeals, EES moved in and was able to sign deals worth $1 million in three \nweeks time.  EES has received kudos from the highest levels of Enron for this \neffort, which continues today.  Martin Wenzel and Doug Condon of EES \norigination have stated their belief that these deals would not have happened \nwith the assistance of Government Affairs.\n\n2000 NPV estimated by Doug Condon: $1 million and growing\n% Attributed to Enron's  GA Efforts: 90%\n\n\nENA\n\nNote:  Tim Belden, VP West Trading Desk, discussed with me how these \nvaluations would be used.  He found it difficult to assess Gov Affairs' \ncontribution to the ENA dollars made.  In the end, he settled on the concept \nthat Government Affairs works, sometimes for years, to present ENA with an \nopportunity to make money and then it is up to ENA to run with it.  So, the \nvalue Tim provides is the value ENA made with the opportunity.  I think this \nis consistent with the way Dennis Benevides calculated the value for me.\n\n\nFTR Release April 1, 2000\nI have spearheaded the release of firm transmission rights in CA since I \njoined the Company in 11/96.  When I joined Enron, the plan of market \nparticipants was to have financial-only rights.  I began working immediately \nto move people in the direction of physical rights. A very long and painful \nfight ensued, including a number of personal appearances by Bill Hogan. This \nculminated with an ISO decision to have physical-type FTRs and to release \nsome, but not all, FTRs in April of this year.  ENA actively participated in \nthe auction and became the largest single purchaser of FTRs.  The new \ncongestion management approach, which Enron also spearheaded, will require \n100% release of FTRs, but will not take effect until next year. This \nvaluation looks only at the FTR release in 2000.\n\n2000 NPV estimated by Tim Belden: $20 million\n% Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 90%\n\n\nISO Price Caps\nPrice caps have been discussed in California beginning a few days after the \nmarket opened in April 1998.  Over the course of the last two years, \nGovernment Affairs had as a number one priority to provide rapid advance \ninformation on price caps, educate Board members on the effects of price \ncaps, and, when appropriate, work to move price caps.  By June, 2000, ENA had \na substantial long position in the market in the West and had millions at \nrisk when lower price caps began to be discussed in CA in mid June.  \nGovernment Affairs, working with Dave Parquet and others, was instrumental in \ndelaying the movement to lower price caps by six weeks, thereby giving ENA \ntime to move out of those positions in an orderly fashion .  The following \nevents happened in 2000.  We entered the year with a price cap of $750, \nhaving fought to raise it to that level in 1999.  In March 2000, the ISO \nconsidered lowering the price cap to $500 but voted to leave it at $500, \nbecause the Board believed at the time that market power had been adequately \nmitigated.  After the three very high-priced days in June, the ISO considered \nlowering the price cap to $250 with a vote on June 22. Government Affairs \ninitiated an all-out lobbying effort to convince Board members and their \nconstituents to oppose lower price caps.  We also lobbied interest groups, \nbanks, venture capitalists, NYMEX and others to weigh in on this issue with \nindividual Board Members and the Board itself, going so far as to set up a \nspecial arrangement with the ISO staff to allow interested parties to address \nthe Board telephonically.  The vote on June 22 failed by ONE VOTE. Instead, \nthe Board lowered the price cap to $500.  The Board voted again on July 1 to \nlower the cap and again the vote failed by ONE VOTE.  Finally, on August 1, \nthe Board approved the $250 price cap, effective August 7.  In the end, it \nwas the end-use customers, Enron and the generators who opposed price caps.  \nUtilities and munis favored them. Enron was the only party lobbying against \nthe lower price caps (the generators gave up early in the fight) and had \nsignificant credibility with the end-use customer reps on the Board.\n\n2000 NPV estimated by Tim Belden:  $16 million\n% Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 70%\n\n\nNew Market-Oriented Board Member\nThe ISO recently held Board elections for the first time.  Government Affairs \nactively sought market-oriented individuals to run for the Board and replace \nthose that do not support competitive markets.  Enron was successful in \ngetting about five to run.  The Members selected or confirmed by the EOB have \nbeen held up and we do not yet know the outcome of those Board seats.  \nHowever, one seat of interest has been decided.  Dave Parquet suggested a \npotential municipal representative who was extremely market-oriented (Michael \nWood, Attorney for the City of Pittsburgh).  Government Affairs worked with \nhim closely to decide which seat to run for, help him prepare his \napplication, suggest lobbying tactics, assist in lobbying and support him \nwith other Board Members.  He won the election and became a Board Member in \nearly September.  This effort is significant, because the munis voted nearly \n100% in support of lower price caps. The position he took was one of those \nvotes.  All other things being equal, we have now added a vote on our side \nthat could be instrumental in defeating further efforts to impose lower or \nadditional price caps, given the close votes that have taken place thus far.\n\n2000 NPV: Tim did not feel this is measurable at this time, but agreed it \ncould be worth millions if future votes are as close as they have been\n% Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 100%\n\n\n\n\n",

S Gurumurthy, Sangh Parivar's=\r\n=20\r\nswadeshi ideologue, had been invited to deliver a lecture on a serious issu=\r\ne=20\r\n`Challenges and opportunities before the country'. But also sharing the dai=\r\ns=20\r\nwith him, and speaking on the subject, were film stars Amrish Puri and Pooj=\r\na=20\r\nBatra. It was clear that he was not too happy about this.\r\nI was in the audience waiting for the conference to end. I had to take=20\r\nGurumurthy to lunch. His speech ended with muted but unmistakably snide=20\r\nremarks from the audience. But, he also walked away with maximum applause. =\r\nTo=20\r\nme, this illustrated the most striking element about his personality: you c=\r\nan=20\r\nlove Gurumurthy or hate him; but you can't ignore him.=20\r\nWe walked to the neighbouring Samrat Hotel's Kamakshi restaurant, because=\r\n=20\r\nGurumurthy likes simple south Indian vegetarian food. Straightaway, we=20\r\nordered rasam and papad as starters. Gurumurthy was still upset. \"The=20\r\norganisers should have prepared the audience for such serious topics as=20\r\nthis,\" he said.=20\r\nAs the bowls of rasam and the papad arrived, I prepared myself for a sessio=\r\nn=20\r\nwith the man considered to be an influential link between the RSS and the=\r\n=20\r\nBJP. He wields tremendous clout, but avoids displaying it on his sleeve.=20\r\n\"Were you always in the RSS?\" I asked. \"No, I was closely associated with=\r\n=20\r\nKamraj-ji's Congress till his death,\" he said, to my surprise. \"Kamraj-ji=\r\n=20\r\nused to like me a lot, and our approach was to de-Dravidianise Tamil Nadu=\r\n=20\r\npolitically,\" he revealed.=20\r\nThis figured! I know this is politically incorrect, but it must be said.=20\r\nGurumurthy is a Brahmin, and like most of his ilk, he was ideologically at=\r\n=20\r\nthe receiving end of the virulent anti-Brahmin movement which swept Tamil=\r\n=20\r\nNadu in the 1960s. That it has now waned, and even leaders of Dravidian=20\r\nparties follow Brahminical rituals these days, says a lot about the=20\r\nrethinking on the issue.=20\r\n\"Are you a practitioner of Brahminism?\" I asked. This was a `Did you beat=\r\n=20\r\nyour wife last night?' kind of question. I wanted to provoke Gurumurthy, wh=\r\no,=20\r\neven his colleagues admit, symbolises traditional Brahminism. Gratifyingly,=\r\n=20\r\nhe rose to the bait. \"Call me Brahminist or retrograde, it doesn't bother m=\r\ne.=20\r\nIf Dravidianism is good, then Brahminism is equally good,\" Gurumurthy said,=\r\n a=20\r\nflash of belligerence flaring. He explained his political theory of=20\r\nde-Dravidianisation of Tamil Nadu. \"Dravidianism was political speculation=\r\n=20\r\nwhich became political reality. It (Dravidianism) was poison injected by th=\r\ne=20\r\nBritish,\" he said.=20\r\nThat Gurumurthy originally came from the Congress fold was news, but more=\r\n=20\r\nrevelations were to follow. He was most appreciative of Indira Gandhi's=20\r\nefforts to de-Dravidianise Tamil Nadu by forging an alliance with the DMK i=\r\nn=20\r\nthe 1970s. \"This was indeed a positive contribution of Indira Gandhi,\" he=\r\n=20\r\nsaid. Coming from a Sangh stalwart, this was significant.=20\r\nAfter Kamraj's death, Gurumurthy found himself in the company of the=20\r\nlegendary and irrepressible media baron, Ram Nath Goenka. From here began h=\r\nis=20\r\nassociation with the RSS. \"It was=20\r\na political assignment,\" he said,=20\r\nrecounting the past. This was=20\r\nthe time when Jayaprakash Narayan began his war against Indira Gandhi, and=\r\n=20\r\nGoenka's=20\r\nThe Indian Express played a crucial role in the campaign. \"Obviously, in=20\r\nthose circumstances, my job was more than a financial adviser's,\" he said.=\r\n=20\r\n\"But how did you get attracted to the RSS,\" I asked curiously. \"It was the=\r\n=20\r\nsincerity of people in the RSS that attracted me. They are the gentlest=20\r\npeople I have ever come across. Had I not come into contact with the RSS, I=\r\n=20\r\nwould have been a hundred times richer in terms of money, but I would have=\r\n=20\r\nbeen a thousand times poorer in other respects,\" said the chartered=20\r\naccountant who virtually reveres his association with the Sangh Parivar.=20\r\n\"But you're influential because you are associated with the RSS,\" I said. A=\r\nt=20\r\none or other time, many in the party and government have felt (and said) th=\r\nat=20\r\nGurumurthy and his Swadeshi Jagran Manch hold a brief for only some Indian=\r\n=20\r\nindustrialists and use their closeness to the RSS to camouflage this.=20\r\n\"Give me one example when I've used my influence in the government,\" he sai=\r\nd=20\r\nflatly. \"You have suggested to the Prime Minister indirectly that he should=\r\n=20\r\nremove an officer from the PMO,\" I said. \"Indirectly! No, you are mistaken.=\r\n=20\r\nThis was a direct suggestion. Such officers are a blot on a great leader li=\r\nke=20\r\nAtal Bihari Vajpayee, and I have never been circumspect on the issue,\" he=\r\n=20\r\nsaid, adding that had he been influential, his suggestions would have been=\r\n=20\r\naccepted. \"My opinion may be powerful, but it does not mean I wield power,\"=\r\n=20\r\nhe explained.=20\r\nGurumurthy asked for curd-rice for the main course, a dish all south Indian=\r\n=20\r\nBrahmins swear by (it is also P V Narasimha Rao's favourite food). He=20\r\ncontinued on the earlier theme. \"It is unfortunate that in 50 years, the=20\r\nsystem has produced very few Bhure Lals (an IAS officer who was one of V P=\r\n=20\r\nSingh's favourite officers).\"=20\r\nWhat did he think about the present government? \"The problem is that an=20\r\nAnglo-Saxon class continues to rule the country. Such people have serious=\r\n=20\r\nlimitations in understanding Indian realities. They run the country like a=\r\n=20\r\nBishop runs the Church. In the process, elite India has become the real=20\r\nIndia,\" he said. Being a believer in cultural nationalism, Gurumurthy=20\r\nhastened to add, \"This divide is only perceptional. What links them is even=\r\nts=20\r\nlike the Kumbh. Culture and religion are the interface where elites and=20\r\nsubaltern meet. This is why secular parties are oblivious to real India,\" h=\r\ne=20\r\nsaid.=20\r\n\"You have been consistent in opposing the government's economic policies. W=\r\nhy=20\r\nis it that even Vajpayee, who belongs to the Sangh, is pursuing the same=20\r\ncourse?\" I asked. What I really wanted to know was his views on the=20\r\nspeculation about strained relation between the government and the Sangh=20\r\nParivar on economic issues.=20\r\n\"The government is not the sole arbiter of economic issues. This is=20\r\ndetermined outside the government. Just as the atmosphere for socialism was=\r\n=20\r\ndetermined by forces outside the government, the atmosphere needed to pursu=\r\ne=20\r\npolicies of globalisation is being decided outside the government,\" he said=\r\n.=20\r\n\"If this is such an obvious trap, why are people like Vajpayee and Yashwant=\r\n=20\r\nSinha falling into it?\" I demanded. \"They cannot function in isolation. Wha=\r\nt=20\r\nwe have is intellectual extremism of the English-speaking class,\" he said.=\r\n=20\r\n\"Extremism?\" I asked, as we ordered coffee.=20\r\n\"They (the English-speaking class) are the one who espoused Enron's cause.=\r\n=20\r\nThey are the ones who suggested that billions of foreign exchange would pou=\r\nr=20\r\nin once the insurance sector was opened up. Did they prove to be correct?\"=\r\n=20\r\nGurumurthy asked triumphantly. \"Are these people, including the financial=\r\n=20\r\nnewspapers, ready to accept that they were wrong in their assessment?\" he=\r\n=20\r\nsaid. \"If the people who supported Enron accept that it was a mistake, the=\r\n=20\r\ncountry would be 50 per cent more intelligent.\"=20\r\nHe continued: \"This class never accepts that the past was=20\r\na mistake. Forgetting the past is=20\r\na typical characteristic, whether it is the issue of the Ram Temple,=20\r\nsocialism or Enron\".=20\r\nPerhaps, this was the closest Gurumurthy could come to admitting his growin=\r\ng=20\r\ndisenchantment with the present regime. On reforms, he said: \"Policies are=\r\n=20\r\nlargely bureaucracy-led, and there is no political control over what is=20\r\nbelieved to be reforms,\" he said. Another intriguing statement!=20\r\nWe finished lunch and prepared to leave. I mentally summed up all that=20\r\nGurumurthy had said. The one thing that came forcefully to mind was his=20\r\ncomplete contempt for anyone (including those in his own party) who belongs=\r\n=20\r\nto what he calls the \"Anglo-Saxon class\". As I bid him goodbye, I decided=\r\n=20\r\nthat to get to the bottom of that mystery will need many more lunches.=20\r\nGurumurthy's subconscious needs to be explored. It is a puzzle, wrapped in =\r\nan=20\r\nenigma.\r\n\r\n`NTPC should also absorb some part of DPC power'\r\nRenni Abraham MUMBAI\r\n\r\n02/07/2001\r\nBusiness Standard=20\r\n3\r\nCopyright (c) Business Standard=20\r\n\r\nMaharashtra finance and planning minister Jayant Rajaram Patil has said tha=\r\nt=20\r\ninvocation of the government of India counter-guarantee by the Dabhol Power=\r\n=20\r\nCompany has set the stage for the resolution of the Enron crisis. Talking t=\r\no=20\r\nBusiness Standard, Patil spoke on the state government's future course of=\r\n=20\r\naction and several other issues.=20\r\nExcerpts:\r\nPlease comment on DPC invoking the Centre's counter-guarantee.=20\r\nThe move is aimed at resolving the crisis. We have made it clear that the=\r\n=20\r\nhigh DPC tariffs have become unaffordable for the Maha-rashtra State=20\r\nElectricity Board. Also, it is not financially prudent for the state=20\r\ngovernment to bail out MSEB in respect of the DPC payments every month. A=\r\n=20\r\nlogical solution has to be found within the MSEB itself which has to be abl=\r\ne=20\r\nto absorb the DPC power. With the GOI counter-guarantee invoked, the state =\r\nis=20\r\nset for resolving the whole issue. The solution has to involve the central=\r\n=20\r\ngovernment as it was the Centre that had invited the power major and=20\r\nsolicited others like Cogentrix to invest. Maharashtra, with a favourable=\r\n=20\r\nindustrial climate, became the testing ground for the setting up of first=\r\n=20\r\nsuch power project.=20\r\nWhat led to the present crisis and how is this being addressed to? Even the=\r\n=20\r\nsetting up of review committee has been inordinately delayed?=20\r\nMaharashtra economy cannot sustain payments to DPC's phase II, which too ha=\r\ns=20\r\nbeen sanctioned. I do not want to rake up the politics behind this. We have=\r\n=20\r\nto look forward to resolving the problem on hand.=20\r\nAs far as Maharashtra is concerned, the eight-party Democratic Front=20\r\ngovernment has unanimously decided that the present high DPC tariff is not=\r\n=20\r\naffordable and has to be rationalised. The Centre has to actively look into=\r\n=20\r\nit.=20\r\nAs far as the delay in the review committee's constitution is concerned, th=\r\ne=20\r\ntask would be completed soon. We have shortlisted a number of experts and a=\r\nre=20\r\nseeking to constitute an independent body of experts to look at the multifo=\r\nld=20\r\naspect of the DPC project and suggest ways to resolve the present crisis. T=\r\nhe=20\r\npanel would probably be asked to immediately submit a set of recommendation=\r\ns=20\r\nto resolve the issues at hand, while looking at the various other options=\r\n=20\r\nbefore it and suggest multifold recommendations to the government.=20\r\nWhat options does the government have?=20\r\nThere are several lines of thought with regard to resolving the DPC issue.=\r\n=20\r\nThe state government is clear that the DPC will have to make available=20\r\ncheaper power. Another option could be staggering phase II. For instance,=\r\n=20\r\nblock B and C of phase II could be staggered. We know that once the jetty f=\r\nor=20\r\nLNG is commissioned by DPC the tariffs would be reduced substantially.=20\r\nSimilarly, we would be keen to look into the possibility of restructuring t=\r\nhe=20\r\nrupee-dollar arrangement so that the risk of foreign exchange fluctuations=\r\n=20\r\nare reduced. The panel would look into this aspect as well. MSEB has to be=\r\n=20\r\nable to afford DPC power. Along with cheaper tariffs, it might also be=20\r\nnecessary for the National Thermal Power Corporation to absorb some part of=\r\n=20\r\nthe power generated by DPC. The Centre should take some component from Phas=\r\ne=20\r\nI and II. We have to resolve the present crisis as a nation and a state.=20\r\nWhy did DPC not invoke the Letter of Credit before the GOM and GOI=20\r\nguarantees?=20\r\nThe Rs 135 crore LC was not invoked for obvious reasons. By invoking the GO=\r\nM=20\r\nand GOI guarantees, a dead-end has been reached as far as brokering pieceme=\r\nal=20\r\nsolutions are concerned. Now the issue has to be resolve in totality.=20\r\nWe want to reach a new understanding with DPC on the project in which the=\r\n=20\r\nCentre will have to get into the picture.

A measure enacted by the=20\r\nLegislature last week, which made state government the biggest electricity=\r\n=20\r\nbuyer in California, suspended further retail competition, preventing anyon=\r\ne=20\r\nfrom underbidding the state.=20\r\n\"That buries us,\" said Tony Wayne, president of UtiliSource of Brea, which,=\r\n=20\r\nunder the new law, can keep its relatively small number of customers but is=\r\n=20\r\nbarred from entering into new contracts.=20\r\nFew thought it would come to this.=20\r\nHigh Hopes Collide With Reality=20\r\nAlmost 300 firms registered with the state to sell electricity to consumers=\r\n.=20\r\nMany of them, quick-buck hucksters or small-time operations, were scared of=\r\nf=20\r\nby background checks, fingerprinting and the $25,000 deposit required to=20\r\nenter the market.=20\r\nBut then there were the likes of giant Enron Corp., which predicted that th=\r\ne=20\r\nnew market would pull 700,000 customers from the utilities in the first few=\r\n=20\r\nweeks. Another firm deployed 400 salespeople, nabbing residential and=20\r\nbusiness prospects by the thousands.=20\r\nThey quickly discovered that the structure of California's landmark=20\r\nderegulation effort erected protective barriers preventing most retailers=\r\n=20\r\nfrom beating the prices of the big three utilities--Southern California=20\r\nEdison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric.=20\r\nFor example, deregulation law allowed the utilities to keep their 9 million=\r\n=20\r\ncustomers until each took the initiative to switch. Any ratepayer who used =\r\na=20\r\nmoderate amount of energy and wanted to change companies had to pay $600 fo=\r\nr=20\r\na new meter--unless the retailer wanted to eat the cost itself.=20\r\nIn contrast, Pennsylvania, where deregulation has been more successful than=\r\n=20\r\nin California, requires most of its utilities to surrender some of their=20\r\ncustomers. Last year, 300,000 customers of one utility were auctioned off t=\r\no=20\r\nthe retailer who could promise them the most savings. All together, close t=\r\no=20\r\n1 million customers have switched from utilities to retailers, with savings=\r\n=20\r\nestimates ranging from a few dollars to $15 per month.=20\r\nIn California, the next barrier was expressly designed by deregulation=20\r\narchitects to keep new retailers at bay, at least temporarily.=20\r\nBefore throwing utilities into a free-for-all, lawmakers felt obligated to=\r\n=20\r\ngive them time to pay off debts that would hurt their ability to offer=20\r\ncompetitive prices. The Legislature froze customer prices at 1996 levels,=\r\n=20\r\nwell above what the utilities were then paying for electricity. The=20\r\ndifference would be used to pay their debts.=20\r\nThe hitch for prospective retailers was that their customers--like those=20\r\nremaining with utilities--would be charged the extra amount too. That=20\r\nseriously hurt the retailers' ability to shave prices for their customers=\r\n=20\r\nwithout taking a hit themselves.=20\r\nUtility executives say the so-called competition transition charge=20\r\naccomplished its intent: providing some protection against new players unti=\r\nl=20\r\nthe utilities could shed their debt and compete on an even field.=20\r\nAccording to those executives, the plan went awry when wholesale electricit=\r\ny=20\r\nprices soared before the special debt charge was lifted and competition had=\r\n a=20\r\nchance to flourish.=20\r\n\"We haven't had enough time for this market to work,\" said Denise Grant,=20\r\ndirector of the Edison division that works with retailers. She said Edison=\r\n=20\r\nexpected to lose 150,000 customers annually--a far cry from what has=20\r\nhappened.=20\r\nRetailers say they faced other obstacles that seemed designed to help the=\r\n=20\r\nutilities keep as many of their customers as possible.=20\r\nOne of the biggest was a newly created energy marketplace called the Power=\r\n=20\r\nExchange.=20\r\nUnder the exchange's rules, all buyers--little guys with a few hundred=20\r\ncustomers and mammoth utilities with millions--paid the same price for=20\r\nelectricity. Once again, retailers were stymied in their search for ways to=\r\n=20\r\ncut their customers' bills.=20\r\nRetailers had no place else to shop for energy because suppliers could make=\r\n=20\r\nmore money selling in high volume to billion-dollar utilities on the Power=\r\n=20\r\nExchange, rather than cutting small deals with upstart companies.=20\r\nWayne, the president of UtiliSource, learned the hard way. He was peddling=\r\n=20\r\nelectricity in California in early 1997, before the state created the Power=\r\n=20\r\nExchange. After arranging a good, but informal, deal with a Washington=20\r\ngenerator, he sent out hundreds of salespeople, took to the road himself an=\r\nd=20\r\nsoon cornered 10,000 customers.=20\r\nBut the birth of the exchange caused the death of his deal, Wayne said. The=\r\n=20\r\ngenerators pulled out when they realized how much money they could make=20\r\nselling on the open market.=20\r\n\"That was an oh-my-god. They said, 'Why should we give you a discount when =\r\nwe=20\r\ncan sell it to the Power Exchange ourselves?' \" he said.=20\r\nRetailers say the state protects the utilities in subtler but no less=20\r\ndamaging ways. That includes billing customers who switch companies for=20\r\ncertain overhead costs of their old utilities, such as weather forecasters=\r\n=20\r\nand accountants involved in procuring electricity.=20\r\nIn late 1999, a coalition of retailers filed a complaint with the Public=20\r\nUtilities Commission arguing that their customers should not be forced to p=\r\nay=20\r\ncosts for utilities they had decided to leave.=20\r\nEarlier this month, the PUC finally reached a decision that favors the=20\r\nretailers' argument but accepts the utilities' calculations of the expenses=\r\n=20\r\nborne by retailers, an amount critics say is far too low.=20\r\nIn dissenting, Commissioner Richard A. Bilas called the decision's paltry=\r\n=20\r\naward to retailers another strike against them.=20\r\n\"We cannot keep stymieing retail competition if we are seeking rational=20\r\nmarkets,\" he said. \"Energy service providers [retailers] have left the stat=\r\ne=20\r\nin droves. . . . They need all the encouragement we can give them.\"=20\r\nRetailers Found Little Opportunity=20\r\nBe they multinational giants or kitchen-table entrepreneurs, retailers are=\r\n=20\r\ndismayed by their experiences with deregulation.=20\r\nEnron spent $5 million trying to sell electricity in 1997 and the spring of=\r\n=20\r\n1998. But, unable to offer enticing discounts, the firm picked up only 30,0=\r\n00=20\r\ncustomers.=20\r\nIn a recent meeting with reporters and editors at The Times, Enron Chief=20\r\nExecutive Kenneth Lay suggested that the framers of deregulation kept marke=\r\nt=20\r\nforces pinned down in the retail sector. As a result, there was little mone=\r\ny=20\r\nto be made and little incentive to stick around.=20\r\n\"The more customers you signed up,\" Lay said, \"the more [money] you lost.\"=\r\n=20\r\nLast week, Enron returned a number of its remaining electricity contracts t=\r\no=20\r\nPG&E. \"In the end,\" Lay said, \"we couldn't change the rules and we pulled=\r\n=20\r\nout.\"=20\r\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Paul Oshideri is now a one-man operation=\r\n=20\r\nsince he laid off his seven employees during his unprofitable two years=20\r\ntrying to entice customers to Cucamonga Energy.=20\r\n\"You don't have that many options,\" said Oshideri, who is still holding on =\r\nto=20\r\nhis 250 customers and vows not to quit. \"What can you do? You can't do=20\r\nanything right now.\"=20\r\nOnly when it came to businesses and big institutions such as universities=\r\n=20\r\nwere retailers able to make a dent in the market. The small price reduction=\r\ns=20\r\nthey offered translated into huge savings for those large users of=20\r\nelectricity. The retailers also offered a variety of other services,=20\r\nincluding aid to help businesses become more energy efficient.=20\r\nAlthough fewer than 2% of all residential customers have switched to new=20\r\nenergy companies, 13% of industrial users have done so, according to the=20\r\nPublic Utilities Commission.=20\r\n\"If they'd structured this differently they would have had households able =\r\nto=20\r\nmake big savings just like industrials,\" said Cal State Fullerton economist=\r\n=20\r\nRobert Michaels.=20\r\nThere is some dispute among deregulation critics over whether legislators=\r\n=20\r\ndesigned the law to protect the utilities from an onslaught of competition,=\r\n=20\r\nor it just turned out that way.=20\r\nJesse Knight, a former member of the Public Utilities Commission who=20\r\ndissented on the panel's deregulation plan, said the law is biased against=\r\n=20\r\nretail competition.=20\r\n\"But I don't think it was the legislation's intent to protect the monopoly,=\r\n\"=20\r\nKnight said.=20\r\nThere is general agreement, however, that not enough attention was paid to=\r\n=20\r\nthe mechanics of the retail market.=20\r\nMuch of the deregulation legislation deals with generation, transmission an=\r\nd=20\r\nwholesale prices of electricity. The only provisions on the retail end simp=\r\nly=20\r\nallow consumers to shop for deals.=20\r\nLay, the Enron executive, recalled that the utilities fought hard to mainta=\r\nin=20\r\ntheir customer base. The irony is that, with wholesale prices skyrocketing=\r\n=20\r\nover the last six months, buying electricity for all those customers has=20\r\ndriven the utilities to the brink of insolvency.=20\r\n\"With 20-20 hindsight, I expect they wish they'd agreed to more choice at t=\r\nhe=20\r\ncustomer level,\" Lay said. \"Then maybe they wouldn't be in the circumstance=\r\ns=20\r\nthey're in.\"\r\n\r\nBusiness/Financial Desk; Section C\r\nCOMPANY NEWS\r\nDABHOL, ENRON UNIT IN INDIA, INVOKES PAYMENT GUARANTEE\r\nBy P.J.

And the buyers have=\r\n=20\r\nbeen slow and stupid,\" said John White, an environmental lobbyist who track=\r\ns=20\r\nenergy issues. \"What I wish is that the buyers' side of the California mark=\r\net=20\r\nhad people as smart and clever and aggressive as Enron.\"=20\r\nEven as California overhauls its market, Enron will likely play a big part =\r\nin=20\r\nthe state's energy future.=20\r\nPartly as a result of state and federal policies that Enron has championed,=\r\n=20\r\nwholesale trading is now a crucial link in the process of delivering=20\r\nelectricity to homes and businesses nationwide. Those policies are unlikely=\r\n=20\r\nto change under President George W. Bush, who counts Enron chairman Ken Lay=\r\n=20\r\nas a friend, campaign contributor and energy adviser.=20\r\nEnron reported record operating profits of $1.3 billion last year, excludin=\r\ng=20\r\none-time adjustments. That's up 32 percent from 1999.=20\r\nMost of its revenue came from wholesale operations. While Enron doesn't=20\r\nprovide financial results for each state, company CEO Jeff Skilling said th=\r\nis=20\r\nweek that California accounted for about 7 percent of the company's $100=20\r\nbillion in sales.=20\r\n\"We've probably bought and sold more power than any other market-maker in t=\r\nhe=20\r\nWest,\" said Enron executive vice president Steven Kean.=20\r\nOriginally a gas pipeline firm, Enron now has many interests, from building=\r\n=20\r\npower plants in India to trading wood products and telecommunications=20\r\nbandwidth on-line. It recently launched a venture with Blockbuster to deliv=\r\ner=20\r\nvideos over a fiber optic network. But Enron's primary business involves=20\r\nacting as a middleman between energy producers and the companies that deliv=\r\ner=20\r\npower to consumers.=20\r\nAt the company's 50-story Houston headquarters, Enron traders use=20\r\nsophisticated software to monitor supply and demand, often based on such=20\r\nvariables as weather, plant breakdowns and availability of fuel.=20\r\nTraders buy power from sources all over the region -- independent generator=\r\ns,=20\r\nlocal utilities, public agencies or other traders -- and assume the risk of=\r\n=20\r\nfinding someone willing to pay a little more. Or they will contract to sell=\r\n=20\r\nelectricity at a certain rate, betting on their ability to obtain that powe=\r\nr=20\r\nmore cheaply.=20\r\n\"They'll take positions based on where they think prices are going to go,\"=\r\n=20\r\nsaid Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, which has 30 member=\r\n=20\r\nfirms. \"This is a guessing game. Enron does it better than most.\"=20\r\nEnron's traders may buy from several sources to supply one customer. Or the=\r\ny=20\r\nmight purchase a large volume and sell it off in slices, either on the spot=\r\n=20\r\nmarket or in long-term contracts.=20\r\n\"They understand financial markets and they understand risk management,\" sa=\r\nid=20\r\nJim Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University. \"That gives them a=\r\n=20\r\nbig competitive advantage over the old dinosaurs of the industry.\"=20\r\nEnron pioneered such trading, he said, building on skills it developed in t=\r\nhe=20\r\nnatural gas business. But today, most power companies are involved in simil=\r\nar=20\r\ndeals.=20\r\n\"As a generator, my production cost might be 20 cents,\" Ackerman said. \"If=\r\n=20\r\nsomeone else is offering the same commodity for 18 cents, just for this wee=\r\nk,=20\r\nI'll shut down my plant and buy their power and then turn around and resell=\r\n=20\r\nit.\"=20\r\nSome critics suggest a market based on such price changes is too risky for =\r\na=20\r\ncommodity as essential as electricity. Attorneys have filed two consumer=20\r\nlawsuits accusing generators and traders of manipulating supplies to drive =\r\nup=20\r\nprices.=20\r\nBut traders deny those allegations. Enron's Kean said they help find supply=\r\n=20\r\nto meet demand, while their long-term contracts protect buyers from price=\r\n=20\r\nspikes. Kean said Enron makes a profit buying and selling, no matter if=20\r\nprices are high or low.=20\r\nThose transactions are increasingly integral to the energy industry as it=\r\n=20\r\ntries to balance out surpluses and shortages around the region. Ackerman=20\r\nestimated the volume of electricity sold back and forth on a given day is=\r\n=20\r\noften ten times the amount actually delivered to consumers.=20\r\nSuch trading will continue, he said, even though the state is now negotiati=\r\nng=20\r\nlong-term contracts with energy providers. \"The traders will still try to=\r\n=20\r\nbeat the costs of serving those contracts.\"=20\r\nAnd traders may benefit from the demise of the state's Power Exchange. The=\r\n=20\r\ncentral spot market is closing because its largest customers, the utilities=\r\n,=20\r\nare insolvent.=20\r\nWithout the exchange to post an hourly rate, said James Bushnell of the=20\r\nUniversity of California Energy Institute, \"there really isn't much in the=\r\n=20\r\nway of meaningful price information any more. And that does advantage=20\r\nmarketers. The cynical interpretation is that if buyers and sellers don't=\r\n=20\r\nhave the information, the marketers can make money.\"=20\r\nEnron was an outspoken opponent of the exchange when California first plann=\r\ned=20\r\nfor deregulation.=20\r\nOver the last decade, Enron has joined forces with manufacturers and=20\r\nindustrial interests in a number of states, as they lobbied for permission =\r\nto=20\r\nbypass local utilities and negotiate for better deals with competing=20\r\nsuppliers.=20\r\nIn challenging the well-entrenched utilities, Enron has built its own=20\r\npolitical clout. The company and its employees gave $2.3 million to federal=\r\n=20\r\ncampaigns in the last election cycle, according to the non-partisan Center=\r\n=20\r\nfor Responsive Politics. Enron donated $235,000 to California campaigns in=\r\n=20\r\n1998, including $75,000 to Gov. Gray Davis.=20\r\nThe company also has deployed its own army of lobbyists and consultants. A=\r\n=20\r\nfew years ago, it hired former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed for=20\r\nadvice on building grass-roots support. In California, it recruited former=\r\n=20\r\nstaffers from the Public Utilities Commission to help make its case.=20\r\nDuring California's early discussions, state regulators embraced a=20\r\nutility-backed plan for a single agency to run the state's transmission gri=\r\nd=20\r\nand operate a central exchange for wholesale energy transactions.=20\r\nBut Enron and its allies argued the agency would be dominated by the=20\r\nutilities, which would discourage competition and make it harder to negotia=\r\nte=20\r\nlower prices.=20\r\nIn the end, California adopted a compromise: It created the Power Exchange =\r\n--=20\r\nmandatory for utilities and voluntary for others -- and a separate agency,=\r\n=20\r\nthe Independent System Operator, to run the state's transmission grid.=20\r\nCritics suggest the complex, decentralized structure has made it easier to=\r\n=20\r\nabuse the market, by withholding supplies or taking advantage of congestion=\r\n=20\r\non the transmission grid to drive up prices.=20\r\nBut no one has produced evidence tying any company to wrongdoing. And Enron=\r\n=20\r\ndenies taking any unfair advantage.=20\r\n\"The fact of the matter is it's easy to blame people from out of state,\" sa=\r\nid=20\r\nKean. \"It tends to deflect attention from some of the real causes of the=20\r\nproblem. The real underlying cause was that you had rapid demand growth and=\r\n=20\r\nyou didn't have enough supply.\"=20\r\nEnron has plans to increase California's supply. Though it currently has on=\r\nly=20\r\nhas a wind-power facility near Tehachapi, it's planning a 750 megawatt=20\r\ngas-powered plant in Kern County and has three more up for licensing.=20\r\nThe company also has sought to build a retail business aimed at industrial=\r\n=20\r\nand commercial clients. It abandoned an earlier effort to sign up residenti=\r\nal=20\r\ncustomers in 1998, after concluding that California utilities had succeeded=\r\n=20\r\nin structuring deregulation to discourage competition for those customers.=\r\n=20\r\nBut Enron has contracts with commercial clients to provide a range of=20\r\nservices, from advising on energy efficiency to supplying power at a=20\r\nguaranteed rate.=20\r\nAs Skilling recently told industry analysts, Enron's business is \"packaging=\r\n=20\r\nenergy supplies for our customers.\"=20\r\nIt doesn't matter, he explained, if that energy comes from a plant that Enr=\r\non=20\r\nowns, or from a contract with another supplier. \"It's all part of one=20\r\nbusiness model.\"\r\n\r\nEditorial Desk; Section A\r\nLiberties\r\nTaxing My Patience\r\nBy MAUREEN DOWD\r\n\r\n02/07/2001\r\nThe New York Times=20\r\nPage 19, Column 1\r\nc. 2001 New York Times Company=20\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON -- At first, I had separation anxiety.=20\r\nI missed all the chaos and intrigue, the lies and cover-ups and sweet talk=\r\n=20\r\nand reconciliations and razzmatazz.\r\nI stalked my ex.

For year=\r\ns,=20\r\nthose contracts weren't worth much. But late last year natural-gas prices=\r\n=20\r\nskyrocketed, especially for gas delivered to California.\r\nThanks to its hold on precious space in one of a handful of pipelines into=\r\n=20\r\nthe state, Anadarko booked about $135 million in extra profit in the fourth=\r\n=20\r\nquarter. It may see more in the first quarter.=20\r\nCall it a California bonanza for natural-gas companies. While wholesale=20\r\nnatural-gas prices have eased in some parts of the country such as in West=\r\n=20\r\nTexas -- where prices are hovering around $5 to $6 per thousand cubic feet =\r\n--=20\r\nthe gas can fetch twice as much if it is delivered in California. Natural g=\r\nas=20\r\nwas recently changing hands at as much as $10 to $15 per thousand cubic fee=\r\nt=20\r\nat Topock, Ariz., a pricing hub on the California border.=20\r\nRegional gas prices often fluctuate because of unusual weather or pipeline=\r\n=20\r\ndisruptions. But California's gas premium has been remarkable for how wide =\r\nit=20\r\nhas grown and how long it has lingered.=20\r\n\"It's a pretty major change in market dynamics,\" says Art Gelber, principal=\r\n=20\r\nat Gelber & Associates, a Houston energy-consulting and asset-resources fir=\r\nm.=20\r\nThe simple explanation for the difference: Natural-gas demand continues to=\r\n=20\r\noutstrip the state's own modest production, and pipeline capacity for=20\r\nout-of-state gas hasn't kept up.=20\r\nAccording to the California Energy Commission, the state produced just 16% =\r\nof=20\r\nthe gas it consumed in 1999, the most recent year for which figures are=20\r\navailable. Of the nearly 5.15 billion cubic feet of gas a day California=20\r\nimported, almost half came from the Southwest, an additional 28% came from=\r\n=20\r\nCanada and 10% from the Rocky Mountain states. To get that gas from the wel=\r\nl=20\r\nto users, gas marketers buy up capacity in a limited number of=20\r\nCalifornia-bound pipelines. With a shortage of pipeline capacity,=20\r\ntransportation costs have climbed and are passed along to end users.=20\r\nCalifornia's pain has turned into unexpected gain for a handful of companie=\r\ns.=20\r\nOccidental Petroleum Corp., a big California gas producer, is finding its g=\r\nas=20\r\nis suddenly much more valuable than it was just a few months ago. In a rece=\r\nnt=20\r\nconference call with analysts, the company noted that prices in California=\r\n=20\r\nhave been more than $3 higher per thousand cubic feet of gas than elsewhere=\r\n=20\r\nin the country, which the company said will be reflected in the first-quart=\r\ner=20\r\nearnings.=20\r\nBoth Occidental and Anadarko have spent time explaining the unusual=20\r\nCalifornia gains to Wall Street, and any windfalls this quarter are likely=\r\n=20\r\nalready priced into their shares, analysts say. In 4 p.m. composite trading=\r\n=20\r\non the New York Stock Exchange, Occidental rose 20 cents to $23.62 while=20\r\nAnadarko rose $2.05 to $63.45.=20\r\nConsidering the companies' diverse oil-and-gas portfolios, California's=20\r\nrecent volatility wouldn't likely move stock prices much anyway. But the=20\r\nexperiences of Occidental and Anadarko in the state highlight what unforese=\r\nen=20\r\nsurprises can pop up in such an unbalanced commodity market.=20\r\nCalifornia is serviced by four major pipelines. Transwestern Pipeline Co., =\r\na=20\r\nsubsidiary of Enron Corp., operates a line from West Texas into Southern=20\r\nCalifornia; El Paso Corp.'s El Paso Natural Gas Co. runs another pipeline=\r\n=20\r\nlargely parallel to Transwestern; PG&E Corp.'s PG&E Gas Transmission Co.=20\r\nbrings gas down from Canada; and Williams Co.'s Kern River pipeline brings=\r\n=20\r\ngas in from the Rocky Mountains.=20\r\nFor years, the contracts on the Kern River line and other pipelines that=20\r\nAnadarko inherited from Union Pacific were money losers as transportation=\r\n=20\r\nrights into California traded at a discount. \"There was plenty of gas going=\r\n=20\r\ninto California and California didn't need any more,\" says David Larson,=20\r\nAnadarko's manager of investor relations. But by the end of last year, the=\r\n=20\r\ncontracts were soaring in value.=20\r\nWith California gas consumption ballooning to meet soaring=20\r\nelectricity-generation demand, the state's pipelines filled up quickly.=20\r\nNormally, other suppliers would redirect gas to places where the price was=\r\n=20\r\nhighest, and the situation would work itself out. But capacity is so limite=\r\nd=20\r\nthat producers simply can't get more gas to California.=20\r\nIn its complicated contractual agreements involving a handful of gas=20\r\nmarketers, Anadarko was able to realize big gains, in essence agreeing to=\r\n=20\r\ntransport other producers' gas into California. Anadarko's contracts lay ou=\r\nt=20\r\nfixed rates for slots in the pipelines, but the company can pocket gains if=\r\n=20\r\nmarket rates for the transportation rise above the fixed rates. Anadarko=20\r\nbooked the fourth-quarter gain by valuing its contracts at current market=\r\n=20\r\nprices, called marking to market.=20\r\nThe contracts stretch out over several years and with rates still volatile,=\r\n=20\r\nAnadarko could book more profit should the market price of the contracts=20\r\ncontinue to soar. Mr. Larson says the contracts could add $10 million to $2=\r\n0=20\r\nmillion to the company's bottom line in the current quarter, though their=\r\n=20\r\nvalue could just as easily fall, resulting in a charge.=20\r\nMeanwhile, Occidental, based in Los Angeles, produces and markets a little=\r\n=20\r\nmore than 300 million cubic feet of natural gas a day in California.

PG&E and Edison piled up debt because California's 1996\r\nelectricity deregulation law set no limits on the price they pay\r\nfor power, but capped the rates they can bill consumers.\r\n    =20\r\nProducers and distributors of power were supposed to match\r\ntheir needs through a central ``pool'' where the price was set\r\ndepending on supply and demand. As demand rose and environmental\r\nrestrictions discouraged building of new power stations, supplies\r\ntightened and generators pushed the price above the rate the\r\nutilities could charge customers.\r\n    =20\r\nPower outages in California show the power pooling system\r\nhasn't benefited customers, said Fuad Jaafar, chief executive of\r\nTenaga, which is two-thirds government owned and the biggest\r\nSoutheast Asian power utility by sales.\r\n\r\n                         Power Down\r\n\r\n    =20\r\nIt's in Australia, though, that the biggest parallels to\r\nCalifornia are being drawn.\r\n    =20\r\nAustralia is the only country in Asia which has split up and\r\nderegulated its power industry, and is one of only four places in\r\nthe world which chose to use the ``pool'' price-setting mechanism,\r\ninvented in the U.K., which has failed in California.\r\n    =20\r\n``Australia is the last place in the world still trying to\r\nget one of these U.K.-style markets to work,'' said Booth.\r\n    =20\r\nAll the others -- California, the U.K., and Alberta province\r\nin Canada -- are abandoning the system because it gives\r\nelectricity generators too much power to manipulate prices to\r\nboost their profits, said Booth.\r\n    =20\r\nBob Lim, an adviser to the Energy Markets Reform Forum, said\r\nits members, large industrial power users in southeastern\r\nAustralia, don't want to be named because they're negotiating\r\npower supply agreements, and finding it difficult to agree\r\n``reasonable'' prices.\r\n    =20\r\n``That's an early symptom of what's happening,'' said Lim.\r\n\r\n``There is a lot of nervousness about the market because of the\r\nfundamentally flawed trading system.''\r\n    =20\r\nWhile there is concern about pool trading, analysts say\r\nAustralia's system is more resilient because unlike in California,\r\nenergy retailers have been able to use forward purchases and other\r\nagreements to fix prices for much of their future power needs.\r\n    =20\r\nMeantime, a number of companies are benefiting from higher\r\npower prices.\r\n    =20\r\nOrigin Energy Ltd., a gas retailer and distributor, is the\r\nbest pick among Australian-listed companies which own generating\r\nplants, said J.B.

That's the way the U.K.\r\nand California are going as well, he said.\r\n    =20\r\nBut he warned that usually there are too few power generators\r\nin an individual market to create sufficient competition that\r\nwould allow regulators to relax.\r\n    =20\r\n``Even with conventional trading systems of the type that\r\nhave been successful, you still have to have enough competition to\r\nkeep people honest,'' said Booth.\r\n\r\n--Stephen Wisenthal in Brisbane (617) 3857-3026, or at\r\nswisenthal@bloomberg.net, Miho Yoshizaki in Tokyo, Renee Kim in\r\nSeoul and Jane Lee in Kuala Lumpur, through the Singapore newsroom\r\n/am/pl\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=09\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Kingdom for A Building Permit\r\n\r\nRise above all the finger-pointing, the shouting, the machinations in the=\r\n=20\r\ndark=01*and many Californians agree: The state desperately needs to build n=\r\new=20\r\npower plants. Over the last decade the population has climbed 14% to 34=20\r\nmillion. The peak demand for electricity (on a hot day in July) has climbed=\r\n=20\r\n19% to 53,000 megawatts. The number of big power plants built in the state=\r\n=20\r\nsince 1990: zero.\r\n\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n=09\r\n\r\n\r\nWho's to blame?

Says Richard Ferguson,=\r\n=20\r\nhead of the Sierra Club's California Energy Committee, \"We need new=20\r\ngeneration, and the old plants are hogging our air space.\"\r\n\r\nThe bureaucrats haven't helped. While the California Energy Commission has=\r\n=20\r\nrecently green-lighted ten new plants, it will be years before they come on=\r\n=20\r\nline. Applications take an achingly slow 12 months to work their way throug=\r\nh=20\r\nthe permit process, compared with 90 days in Texas. (Texas has built nine=\r\n=20\r\nlarge power plants since 1990.) In California as many as 17 assessments=01*=\r\nfrom=20\r\nhistorical significance to\r\nimpact on fish and wildlife=01*can require changes to the blueprints.=20\r\nResult: Ancillary costs to developers in California run as high as $30=20\r\nmillion for one project, compared with $1 million in Texas.=20\r\n\r\nThe utilities deserve some blame for bad forecasting=01*and for the financi=\r\nal=20\r\nruin that is being visited upon them, says Peter Huber in his column (see T=\r\nhe=20\r\nKilowatt Casino). They agreed to buy electricity at spot prices and to sell=\r\n=20\r\nat fixed retail prices, figuring they could clean up on the easy spread=20\r\nbetween the two prices. For several years they did make some nice money thi=\r\ns=20\r\nway. Wholesale prices got as low as 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, while the reta=\r\nil=20\r\nrate was close to 10 cents. Then the wholesale price spiked last summer to =\r\n86=20\r\ncents. The two biggest California utilities, PG&E and Edison International,=\r\n=20\r\nlost $11.1 billion between them since last summer and have wrecked their=20\r\ncredit ratings. Potential builders of generating stations don't want to sel=\r\nl=20\r\nto such shaky customers.=20\r\n\r\nBlame politicians, too, for preventing plant construction. In October=20\r\nGovernor Gray Davis put a ceiling on wholesale rates at 25 cents a=20\r\nkilowatt-hour, but in December he made it a \"soft cap,\" allowing wholesaler=\r\ns=20\r\nto sell above that, if they could provide the state with a reason for=20\r\ncharging more. Still, it had a chilling effect. Right after the governor's=\r\n=20\r\nmove, Calpine, a wholesale generator, yanked six of seven applications to=\r\n=20\r\nbuild so-called peaker plants. These are tiny, 50-megawatt-or-less dynamos=\r\n=20\r\nthat operate only 30 to 45 days a year, when demand peaks and electricity=\r\n=20\r\nshould command a premium price. Twenty-five cents does not go very far in=\r\n=20\r\nthis kind of plant. With the spot price of natural gas at $10 delivered, th=\r\ne=20\r\nfuel for a kilowatt-hour runs about a dime. Now figure in construction cost=\r\ns=20\r\n($25 million for 50 megawatts) that have to be amortized over a relatively=\r\n=20\r\nsmall number of kilowatt-hours and you have a formula for losses if the pla=\r\nnt=20\r\nis in a state where the governor wants to put \"profiteers\" in jail.\r\n\r\nNext on our list of plant-stoppers: the neighbors. Sunlaw's proposal to bui=\r\nld=20\r\na 550-megawatt, $350 million plant in southeast Los Angeles county hasn't h=\r\nit=20\r\nany snags with the CEC or the South Coast Air Quality Management District.=\r\n=20\r\nIndeed, the plant would produce less toxic waste than the steady stream of=\r\n=20\r\ndiesel trucks at the industrial warehouse now at the site. Yet residents of=\r\n=20\r\nthe mostly blue-collar Hispanic neighborhood are crying environmental racis=\r\nm=20\r\nand will put the plant up to a vote in March. \"There is nothing that a loca=\r\nl=20\r\ncommunity cannot defeat,\" says Michael Zenker, a director for Cambridge=20\r\nEnergy Research Associates. The CEC can overrule local jurisdiction, but=20\r\ntries to avoid that whenever possible-it has acted only twice in the last 2=\r\n0=20\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWill the commission now flex its muscles?

Your memo is a little \nvague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have \nnot taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending \ntime with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  \n\nAbsolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I \nbelieve that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from \nEntelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has \nonly recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss \nhow this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I \nknow that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.

I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in \naggregating exposures in our market environment today.

Much effort has been \nput forth in  \"cleansing\" the parent/subsidiary information presented in \nEntelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except \nfor on an ad hoc, manual basis. \n\nWhat is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should \nchanges and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and \ntrading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and \nor systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?\n\nIt appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work \nhas been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading \npositions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share \ncounterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data \npopulation efforts.\n\n Your comments and ideas are welcome. \n\nDebbie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
