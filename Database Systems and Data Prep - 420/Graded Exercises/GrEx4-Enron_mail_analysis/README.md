# Database Systems and Data Prep
The Enron data JSON is too big to check into Github, even after compressing.  So, I split it into 3 files 

enron_data_split_0.json.zip
enron_data_split_1.json.zip
enron_data_split_2.json.zip

and compressed them.  To be able to run any code, you will have to reverse the split done by json-split.py.
