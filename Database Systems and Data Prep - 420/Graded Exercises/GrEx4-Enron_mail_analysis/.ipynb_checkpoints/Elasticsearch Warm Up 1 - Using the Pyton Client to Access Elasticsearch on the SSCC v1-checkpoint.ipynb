The\\ntimeline for the work group's activities included\\na milestone of ERCOT staff delivering a summary of\\nthe Protocol/System gaps on November 15th.  This\\nmessage is the delivery of that summary.\\n\\nThe Consortium conducted a reconciliation of the\\nNovember 1 Protocols to the system design.  ERCOT\\nstaff reviewed the reconciliation provided by the\\nConsortium.  There were a number of issues\\nincluded in the reconciliation that are still\\nunder review with the vendors.  The finalization\\nof that review is being completed as quickly as\\npossible.  Based on the decisions during the\\nreview, there may be some more issues that will\\nneed to be added to the Protocol Implementation\\nPlan (PIP).\\n\\nThere were a number of issues that relate to\\nthings that are in the November 1 Protocols that\\nare not in the current system design and will not\\nbe available on June 1, 2001.  ERCOT staff worked\\nvery hard over the last few days to prepare those\\nissues to be sent to the PIWG for review and\\ncriticality analysis.  ERCOT staff used the\\nNovember 1 Protocols as a baseline.  We boxed the\\nlanguage that related to things that would not be\\navailable and in effect on June 1, 2001.  The box\\nincludes a PIP Issue number, explanation of the\\nreason the Nov. 1 language is in the box, and an\\nexplanation of the restoration process for the\\nNovember 1 language.  In the body of the Protocol\\ndocument, we drafted redline language which\\nreflects what will be in place on June 1, 2001.\\n\\nThe attached files contain:\\n\\n(1)   PIP Master List - This is a master list of\\nall the Protocol Implementation Plan (PIP) issues\\nthat have been identified to date.  It contains an\\nissue name, Protocol subsection reference, summary\\nof the issue, status, and ERCOT author.\\n\\n(2)  A file for each PIP issue which contains an\\nexcerpt from the Nov. 1 Protocol reflecting the\\nboxes and redlined language.\\n\\n(3)  Reconciliation documents for PIP issues that\\nthe PIWG has already discussed.\\n\\nAll of these issues will be discussed at PIWG\\nmeetings.  We will be working with Brad Jones,\\nPIWG Chair, to set up the meeting days and the\\nagenda for reviewing each of these issues.  The\\nagenda will be published prior to the meetings so\\nthat organizations have the opportunity to\\nidentify the appropriate persons to attend.  In\\naddition, ERCOT staff will be working with the\\nPIWG during the discussions of each issue.\\n\\nThe PIWG has a lot to accomplish in a short amount\\nof time.  ERCOT staff has prepared the issues to\\nhelp expedite the process and contribute to the\\nprocess.  We look forward to completing the PIP.\\n\\nCheryl F.
