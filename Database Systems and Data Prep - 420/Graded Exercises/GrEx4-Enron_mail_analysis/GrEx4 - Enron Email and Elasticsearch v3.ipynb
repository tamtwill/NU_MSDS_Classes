The firm filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2 of that year.  The email data was compiled by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for investigative and litigation purposes.  It is now available from diverse sources and in various forms, and it has been researched by many. You can find out about this data at:\n",

The Python ES clients that are available include `elasticsearch` and `elasticsearch_dsl`.  See the ES Jupyter notebooks on Canvas for guidance on connecting to and using ES on the SSCC using the Python `elasticsearch` client.  This is the \"official\" client.  You might find `elasticsearch_dsl` to be a bit more intuitive.  Give it a try if you want."
