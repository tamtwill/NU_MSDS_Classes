### a.k.a. "Table for Four"

This repository holds a sample of the work I created as part of a team project named "Table for Four";   the project was completed Spring term 2018.   Not all files are included here, only items I personally delivered to the project.  I built a large number of models and did a great deal of data cleaning/prepping/augmentation which is not shown here either since there is a fair amount of redundacy in the various models and datasets.  

This is a sample of the code I delivered, and the group writeups for context.  Two of us built models, and of all the models built, one of mine was the "hero model" for our project.
