# Machine Learning

### Course Description
Contemporary computational methods for machine learning, statistics, data mining, and pattern recognition provide opportunities for understanding large, complex datasets. The course introduces machine learning methods with business applications in marketing, finance, and other areas. The course provides a survey of machine learning techniques that can be applied to make informed business decisions: regression and classification methods, resampling methods and model selection, artificial neural networks, tree-based methods, support vector machines and kernel methods, principal components analysis, and clustering methods. Students implement machine learning methods using open-source programming tools. At the end of this course, students will have developed a basic understanding of how methods learn from data, finding underlying patterns useful for prediction, classification, and exploratory data analysis.
