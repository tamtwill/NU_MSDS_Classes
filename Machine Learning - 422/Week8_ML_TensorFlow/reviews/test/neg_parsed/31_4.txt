it hurt watch movie really wanted like even going shot obviously little cash looked past told appreciate inspiration unfortunately although appreciate film level acting editing terrible last minutes severe thumb twiddling territory minute film drag ratings one good far fear friends family might say one transitions dear mr editor purchase first copy adobe premiere make main goal use goofy transitions come silly program anyway better actors little passion appealing editing makes decent movie
