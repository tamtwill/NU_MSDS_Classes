not like went expecting lot least hoping fun dumb big budget movie even item ranks bottom half vampire movies ever seen believe seen lot bad acting zero characterization little thought almost non existent plot drive semi trucks holes sure action loud action noise blood action things alone make good even halfway decent movie beats people say best vampire movie ever made assume seen many suggest seeing near dark instead
