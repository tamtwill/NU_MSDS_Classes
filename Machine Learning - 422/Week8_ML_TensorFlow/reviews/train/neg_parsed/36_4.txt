this film seemed way long even minutes problem jungle horror films always way much footage people walking jungle rocky cliff near river lake pad running time film worth seeing laughable naked native zombie big bulging bloody eyes always accompanied soundtrack heavy breathing lots reverb eurotrash fans plenty entertained bad english dubbing gratuitous female flesh silly makeup jobs monster native extras zombie cannibal flick pretty light gore probably see uncut version
