this kiyoshi kurosawa ghost movie pretty wild least one jump scare caught guard movie incredibly stupid detective trying track suspected serial killer find may committed one crimes finds haunted gorgeous asian lady ghost idea neither viewer murders committed becomes even confused killers easily found ghost still haunts reason plot completely stupid lady ghost funny anything especially suddenly flies across city like wonder woman ending makes little sense fact whole movie makes little sense recommend take serious would think supposed black comedy outside bright future worst movie directed kiyoshi kurosawa seen yet
