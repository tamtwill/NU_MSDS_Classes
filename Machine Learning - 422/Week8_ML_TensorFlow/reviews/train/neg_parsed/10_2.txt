this film lot promise plot relatively interesting however actors director editors seriously let film br br feel bad writers could good acting wooden characters believable br br ever edited clearly learnt new edit techniques wanted splash film lots quick flashy edits almost every scene clearly meant symbolic end annoying br br wanted like film expected decent resolution breakdown equilibrium alas left feeling like wasted time film makers wasted money
