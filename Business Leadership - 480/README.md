<h2>Course Description</h2>

The purpose of this course is to introduce the fundamental leadership theory and associated behaviors that enable students to excel in their analytics careers and to apply these behaviors to personal and professional success. The course builds from the basic premise that leadership is learned. It examines the theory and practice of leadership at the individual and organizational levels, and specifically how to drive effective change management in enterprises at various stages in an enterprise analytics transformation process. Students will be introduced to three weeks of analytics-specific project management, where they will design an analytics project plan using an agile approach incorporating CRISP-DM methodology, and execute that plan in a simulated business setting. Leadership challenges unique to analytics departments in various company sizes will be addressed through the use of case studies and theory-based assignments. The course will focus on developing effective communication strategies and presentations that resonate across business and technical teams.

this for interpersonal influence to drive analytic initiatives in your organization.

research play in effective leadership.

evolution along the analytics adoption curve.
