# NU_MSDS_Courses
##### These are the primary assignments I did during my Masters of Data Science program.  

Not all classes are represented here; some classes didn't have material approprite for archiving in this format.
For each class, I've tried to include the information from the syllabus which articulates the learning outcomes expected each class.

Order classes were taken in:

1.	Math for Modelers – 400: not included here
2.	Intro to Predictive Analytics - 402: sample survey and analysis
3.	Statistical Analysis - 401: Class used **R** for simple data analysis
4.	Database Systems and Data Prep – 420: Class required **Python Jupyter** notebooks for various tasks
5.	Multivariate Linear Regression – 410: Class used **Python**
6.	Generalized Linear Models - 411: Class used **R**
7.	Machine Learning – 422: Class used **Python**
8.	Business Leadership - 480: samples of planning and research for student defined imaginary product
9.	Time Series – 413: Class used **R**
10.	Decision Analytics - 460: not included here.  Class exclusived used an Excel add-in to perform decision optimization
11.	Text Analytics - 453: Class was mostly theory, code done in **Python** 
12.	Capstone - 498: Project done in **R** (mostly) since it was the only language all members knew, one **Python** script
My best Capstone model, scored by making a "late submission", got a Private Score of .502, which would have ranked it in second place in the competition had we been participating while it was "live".
